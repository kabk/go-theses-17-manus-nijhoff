<p>Optimo has gotten a job offer at a wearables company. The team talks tech lifestyle.</p>
<h2 id="soylent">Soylent</h2>
<p>REN:<br />
Hey, I was talking to my friend who eats this stuff called Soylent. Have any of you tried it?</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Soylent, the powder that replaces food! Not a big fan. Also it's not available in the Netherlands for now. I'll stick to my mom's boerenkool.</p>
<p>OPT:<br />
Yeah, I'm using it sometimes. Soylent can replace regular food. It comes in a powder to be mixed up with water and contains all of the nutrients a human body needs. If I am in a rush or uninspired to cook, this stuff helps.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
So, I hear it's also a sustainable solution for the future of food. My first reaction was that if everyone would eat this food, the entire planet could be very well off.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
What is the secret of Soylent Green? üòà <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>OPT:<br />
Nice, Gonzo. The Soylent Green movie is actually based on a sci-fi novel from 01966 called <em>Make Room! Make Room!</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> That book introduced a version of NYC in which overpopulation caused people to resort to Soylent (soy and lentil) and water on ration. The Soylent Green film took a more macabre turn, where Soylent turned out to be made out of humans.</p>

</div>
<p>All jokes aside though. I know it plays into the sentiment of science fiction. But science is also what makes this stuff possible. Rob Rhinehart ‚Äì the guy behind Soylent ‚Äì has a vision of what he calls a world after food. He wants to make it independent from agriculture, eventually. When agriculture doesn't scale<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> with human needs, which he says will happen, this could be the thing to replace it. So it's not just convenient, it's also a step towards a solution for future food problems. According to a report called <em>How To Feed The World 2050</em>,<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> the world will have 9.1 billion citizens that need food. We're going to need to improve things and optimize things and a lot of that comes from science and technology. Soylent is made on the formula of nutritional value per dollar and it is very cost-effective.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Wow. You make it sound like this food will solve all the world's problems. What about the pleasure of eating? Won't you lose that? I've heard Soylent is kind of tasteless. I think this only works if you care purely about the nutritional values and not societal values, like building friendships by enjoying a dinner together.</p>
<p>OPT:<br />
Yeah, that's true. I think the early adopters of this product see food as a resource or a fuel instead of an experience. And that's totally fine. I think you shouldn't see it as a replacement for food, but rather an addition to your regular diet. Like Rob Rhinehart says, Soylent takes care of my needs through the week and I can eat well on the weekends. There hasn't been such a complete food alternative in the past and now it's also open to development for people that are using it themselves. Online, people are making their own versions of Soylent, which are totally customized to their personal needs.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>REN:<br />
I think they're on to something. Food habits have always changed. Why wouldn't we cheer this on? If the alternative is more McDonalds, which has proven to be unhealthy and unsustainable, this is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>OPT:<br />
Right, in an interview with The New Yorker,<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Rhinehart also mentions that Soylent should be approached from an open source perspective. When the interviewer asked him if he wasn't afraid the D.I.Y. community would hinder his business, he said that if someone else figures out a better way to make it, that‚Äôs still a win for humanity.</p>
<p>The people behind Soylent are using their experiences as computer engineers and scientists to optimize food. In their view, everything is made of parts, everything can be broken down. So they looked just at what chemicals a human body needs and put that into one airtight solution.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
This is like the first step into alien territory. All aspects of life are already built to human needs, and Soylent stands for this total solution, which claims to have the answer for all. It's synthetic food, right? That's pretty scary.</p>
<p>OPT:<br />
Well, the fact that it's synthetic is the great thing about it! They claim synthetic is better than natural. Synthetic food means it can be optimized for <em>humans</em>. Synthetic does not mean plastic, it just means that it is made artificially, instead of naturally. In that perspective it really is better food because it only has what people need, nothing more.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
I still think it won't win over the world in a day. But hey, I guess it's a great innovation and I'm curious to see where it goes.</p>
<h2 id="obviously-smart">OBVIOUSLY SMART</h2>
<p>OPT:<br />
I'm sure the people that like efficiency and these kind of things will know about this product. The marketing will probably also aim for a broader audience, not just nerds ‚Äì excuse the words ‚Äì trying to self-optimize.</p>
<p>The comfort of the user is everywhere a key part of the selling formula. Amazon Dash is probably the most striking example of this.</p>
<p>Dash is a button you order from Amazon. Every button is dedicated to one single product with a specific order size. Once you have the Dash button in your house, one press will order a single serve of that product at Amazon, which will be delivered soon thereafter.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Never run out of energy.</p>
</div>
<p>This falls under what is called ‚Äúthe smart home‚Äù.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
Damn, this must be one of the most overtly stupid applications I have seen that marketeers dare to call smart.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Smart of Amazon for sure, though. I know enough people who already buy the same product time after time after time. Amazon just makes life easy for them.</p>
<p>OPT:<br />
That's true, can't argue with that.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
The hacking community has picked up the buttons and are using them for all sorts of fun button activities. Maybe their use of the Dash buttons is worthy the smart label?</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Better off making smart pants like this company Optimo's gonna work for.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
Smarty Pants.</p>
<p>GON: LOL. Alright, let's see. Athos. Raised $35 million<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> in November 02015 and are working on smart pants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAthos. Building a better human machine.‚Äù<br />
Scott Anderson, Director of Athletic Training at Stanford University</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oooh, a better human machine. Is that supposed to sound badass? I'm so unimpressed!</p>
<p>Athos is now selling wearables (wearable technology) that use small EEG sensors to measure muscle activity and give you real-time information about your sports routine. It uses science to convince and athletes to model for their commercials. Renegade, what is your take on all of this? I'm getting a bit fed up here.</p>

</div>
<p>REN:<br />
I think I know exactly what you mean. Are you familiar with Benjamin Bratton's work?</p>
<p>GON:<br />
No, but do tell.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
Benjamin Bratton is professor of visual arts and director of the center for design and geopolitics at the University of California, San Diego. In 02013 he gave a very insightful talk at TEDx San Diego.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> TED is a non-profit organization that originated in California. They organize conferences where speakers talk about their personal involvement in Technology, Entertainment and Design (T-E-D) and more.</p>
<p>Usually a TED speaker will give an insight into a technology they are developing, a project they initiated with a focus how that helps society. The format is key to their existence. Videos have to be under 18 minutes long so they can be uploaded and watched by a big audience online.</p>
<p>Benjamin Bratton used the stage to critique the format TED uses. He argued that TED is not really critical towards technology. Instead, the institution books speakers that tell incredible stories of how technology changes the world while these visions do not always come true. He calls this ‚Äòtoying with technoradicalism.‚Äô Bratton says TED has <em>faith in</em> technology but not enough <em>commitment to</em> technology. The institute puts too much emphasis on the optimal condition. They treat technology from a commercial strandpoint. There are lots of promises, beautiful and elegenat insights, but the talks lacks sharp critique.</p>
<p>Instead, Bratton makes a case for design as immunisation. Design, he says, should not only focus on innovation but also on making ourselves immune for the things we don't need.</p>
<p>I don't know if we need the new pants from Athos. But the problem Bratton addresses towards TED and things like wearables and the Internet of Things do make me take a double take. What's the use of knowing exactly what each muscle does? The makers as well as users of technology put heaps of faith in the products, especially when they appear smart.</p>
