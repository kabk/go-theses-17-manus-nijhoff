<p>The Renegade and Gonzo are amazed by the complexity of the internet. They discuss ways companies handle work behind the screens and wonder if we can learn from that. With Optimo, they talk about the way users and designers can deal with this complexity.</p>
<h2 id="the-shape-of-the-cloud">THE SHAPE OF THE CLOUD</h2>
<p>GON:<br />
The scale of the internet is something mind-boggling to me. Everytime I use the internet, I'm surprised it works.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
I agree. The back end is the place where it all happens. What happens there is the really amazing part of the internet. The back end are the hidden processes, the calculations and programs running for front end services.</p>
<p>OPT:<br />
Tech companies develop products with scalability in mind. Scalability is the ability of a system to become more efficient or optimal when its application grows. Take for example a search engine. The more content it searches, the more interesting the search engine is for its users. Google for ten things is not as useful as Google for a million things, and this becomes more true the bigger we go. How scaling works technically can be extremely complex, so as a user we almost never see processes behind our actions. We see the front end of a process in the shape of an interface, the work happens in The Cloud.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
It's so weird they call the back end ‘The Cloud’. That's misleading users: The Cloud is physical. It is server farms, interconnected via cables. I say wireless is only a half-truth when there are strings attached.</p>

<p>OPT:<br />
I love watching this video<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> of the sorting robots in Amazon's warehouses. How they find their own way through the warehouse is marvelous to see.</p>

The Kiva robots are a good example of how software has shaped the physical world. These robots are an essential part of the Amazon delivery chain and boost delivery speed.

<p>The warehouses no longer store items sorted for humans. Instead, the objects are placed on the shelves according to what is fastest. The system knows what shelves carries which item, the robots carry those shelves to ‘pick-workers’ that take the items out of the shelves and pack them for sending. The robot finds its own way through the warehouse. They can do this without bumping into other robots or human beings.</p>
<p>This way they can process an order from click to send sometimes in less than 15 minutes. Amazon has 21 million different items for sale. The warehouse needs less walking space, because humans don't need to walk through aisles anymore. This operation is scalable as hell.</p>
<p>You'll see the worker doesn't have to do much of anything anymore. The entire system is developed to make human work as simple as possible.</p>

<p>REN:<br />
Wow, I wouldn't want to be one of those. Let me play with the code of those bots, though.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Amazing about this is the system itself. It's impressive how they got all of this to run so smoothly. Even though the pick workers have a bit of a boring job, the comparison is easily made with picking stuff from trees. Was that a much better job? And this means less hard work. Less bending over, reaching. Easy money, no?</p>

<p>REN:<br />
In June 02013, Edward Snowden, who worked for the NSA-affiliated defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton leaked a great amount of files of the USA's National Security Agency's massive surveillance practices. The NSA can spy and did spy on innocent citizens as well as criminals<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> all around the world using back doors to big service providers on the internet.</p>
<p>This is a dark side of a big centralized internet. One part of that darkness is the strong influence of the United States' secret service. Another thing is their access to Silicon Valley's major servers where personal data is stored. Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Skype, you name it. Governments like this centralized power because it's easy access for them.</p>
<p>The structure of the internet hasn't changed much since the beginning. Files are stored on a central server, for instance one from Google. When using Google, all traffic runs through that server and all information is in one place, ready to be intercepted.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/prism.jpg" alt="One of the slides of the NSA that Ed Snowden released. Here we see which companies provided data to the NSA" />
<p class="caption">One of the slides of the NSA that Ed Snowden released. Here we see which companies provided data to the NSA</p>
</div>
<p>The root of the problem is the centralized network. The NSA's concentrated power comes in the form of big, cubical server facilities.</p>
<p>An alternative could be a distributed network. A centralized network has a big, centralized server infrastructure where all the data and files are stored. A decentralized system doesn't have that. There, files are stored on parts of the network.</p>
<p>I've been following the developments of Bitcoin - a cryptocurrency - and with that, the Blockchain. The Blockchain is a technology that offers a new kind of server infrastructure. There are different possibilities, but one example could be: All nodes in the network store a full copy of all transactions on that network while all relevant files and data can stay on individual drives.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> This allows a distributed network. One without a middle man.</p>
<p>It allows for new beginnings, and a new type of internet which is more distributed is harder to control centrally by one or a handful of parties.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Alright, all this is fine and dandy, but what if I know that the technical stuff is very complicated, but I don't care. I just want them to not snoop in?</p>
<p>REN:<br />
This is exactly why setting up things like distributed networks is so important. When ugly things are happening online, we need safe places where activists, journalist, dissidents, whistleblowers and such can have free discussion online. And that should not be so complex that you need to be a coding wizard to understand, because anybody could be stuck in that position and anyone should be able to defend themselves online.</p>
<h2 id="monkeys-and-messiness">MONKEYS AND MESSINESS</h2>
<p>GON:<br />
I still have no idea how the internet works exactly, but I'm starting to recognize some patterns. I have the idea not one person really knows how the entire thing actually works.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
I think for the internet itself, there are some experts that probably know exactly how the protocols work and so on. But we shouldn't always rely on others for understanding the things we use. It's one thing to say that there is an expert somewhere that knows what's going on and we let them do the understanding. But more and more there is no such expert.</p>
<p>A good example is when a big service is being built there is this thing called The <em>Change Review Board</em>. It can be 12 people there, who all have their specialty. One for the network part of things, one for storage, one for application development, et cetera. When they make changes to their parts, they have to state them out loud to the other 11 people in the room to see if that does not interfere with something in their ‘worlds’. They simply don't know! The same people come together when something fails, to find the problem. Can you imagine that? Optimo?</p>
<p>OPT:<br />
Is it okay for me to freak out a little bit over that? I like to be in charge of my own. Is there no hope anymore for control by yourself?</p>
<p>REN:<br />
I think not. A lot of programming is now what we call procedural. That means the programmer has to predict enough states so the computer can do the calculation. <em>If</em> this happens, <em>do</em> that. That's fairly straightforward. But with deep learning or Artificial Intelligence comes another, probabilistic reasoning system. If I see this input, I <em>think</em> I should do that. The computer starts learning and guessing by itself.</p>
<p>Computers were exact precise things, but now we have huge, often messy systems. People have a low tolerance for error for anything that comes out of a computer. That should change when we start to see that they are also biological. Humans are already conditioned to accept complexity that's unavoidable. If a doctor tells you that weird itch won't go away, you learn to accept it, at least a bit. I wonder if we get to the same point with computers.</p>
<p>I think we should go towards a biological thinking approach. These things are very complex. They've evolved over time and have this organic messiness. We need to focus much more on the details of the subsystems (like studying cells in biology). The details of a component in the hope of creating a broader picture. The details really matter.</p>
<p>This is where it also gets interesting for users. We're talking about the back end, but I think it's time for people to learn more about the biological forces behind their devices and entertainment. After all, they must be wondering how this all can be. Now, luckily people are usually much smarter than I think and do they have an idea. But it's not often that we hear more detailed accounts of back end services.</p>
<p>Google pioneered 'continuous failure'. It is not a question if the system will fail, but when.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> They are one of the first to design their back end in a biological way because of this.</p>
<p>One favorite example which mimics biological life is The Chaos Monkey.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Chaos Monkey randomly takes pieces of the server down and sees how it responds. The idea is to lower the gap between how Netflix expects the system to work and how the system actually works. In biology this is how you learn about a living thing. Actively trying to mutate it is a biological technique.</p>

<p>There seem to be a couple of ways of dealing with big computing. We can either freak out or say this is so complicated and are amazed to a point where we can only watch. But both of those cut off questioning.</p>
<p>We need to recognize that it is okay not to always understand. We have to constantly keep trying to understand and should be excited by trying to understand. We can realize things are messy but also that it's something we created.</p>
<p>Regular users should also know that all of our technology can fail. The world is a beta test, no technology is ever fully finished. We are in a way the problem of the tech because of our impatience. In order to help ourselves, we should have a better understanding of technology in society. These should move towards each other instead of keeping users in the dark about what happens behind the screen. That way, we can have useful discussion.</p>
