<h1 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Thanks for reading. I know it wasn't a comfortable ride. The conversations of Optimo, Gonzo and the Renegade still take some editing, cutting and pasting to come across better.</p>
<p>In my research I've been all over the place. Now I want to distill some of the things I've learned.</p>
<p>People are often totally self-responsible for what they do and have to design their life with technology. Some pitfalls come from technology that designers, but also just people should be aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oversimplification. Very handy in programming, not so handy IRL (In Real Life). Trust your audience, they have an imagination. They don't read barcodes, they read stories, ideas, jokes.</li>
<li>Distraction for the sake of distraction.</li>
<li>Reverence of technology is bad, designers come up with ways of demystifying tech!</li>
<li>Use tech as your slaves. I think designers are pretty good at this already. Pass that attitude on to users. They know there's more to life than likes.</li>
<li>Design as immunisation: Actively prevent quasi-innovations from happening.</li>
<li>Be subversive to big systems but learn from them. It can be useful to see Google as your enemy from time to time but it doesn't make sense to blame them for all the problems in the world.</li>
<li>Approach new services with distrust and keep checking what free services get from you. Some things are not made in your best interest.</li>
<li>Ennui principle: Build up and release.</li>
<li>Use the dÃ©rive as an inspiration. Go with the flows of the stream and find all that good stuff.</li>
<li>Always keep messing with things, no matter how big or boring.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to sign off for a bit now. All this internet talk has left me stupid, unreflective, overloaded. But I'll sharpen my typing nails and be back in a day or two. Or less.</p>

<h1 id="afterword">AFTERWORD</h1>
<p>I just want to give this little bit of Benjamin Bratton for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a societal level, the bottom line is that if we invest in things that make us feel good but which don't work, don't invest in things which don't make us feel good, but which may solve problems, then our fate is that in the long run it will just get harder and harder to feel good about not solving problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ðŸ˜ª</p>
<p>DESIGN IS JUST A TOOL. IN THE WRONG HANDS IT WILL DO WRONG THINGS. THE SILICON VALLEY OF DISRUPTION DOES NOT HAVE THE ANSWER, BUT LOOKING AT THEM MAY GIVE SOME IDEAS.</p>
<p>We should be asking what the internet is distracting us from, not how the internet is distracting us.</p>
<p>For fluff sake, it's going to be a very difficult time for the arts. Right-winged politics took the USA, where Mr. Trump took a country by surprise. The biggest party in the Netherlands is racist and will take a lion's share in next February's election. Geert Wilders made public threats to the Morrocan community, he literally said he would CLEAN SHIP without specifiying what. This is harmful. Politicians need to specify what they mean, empty words lead to confusion. Is there really no alternative for this politics of anger?</p>
<p>The internet's distracted us for a nice run. It was fun on there, but we should also really spend some time with people around us. See what they're up to. See what you can do together to have fun, or to help.</p>
<p>A diversion into military equipment (what the internet originally was). Disguised by sleek design, tempting with simple interfaces, catchy flashy sexy sensual all of that but what if that doesn't matter anymore and you're not feeling good in the streets? Everybody has a plan until they get hit in the face. By Big data, refugee crises, politicians with terrible haircuts. And all the while we just want to learn to understand our peers better. Whatttttt has it come 2.</p>
