#Abstract

This thesis is a scripted discussion between three characters: Gonzo, Optimo and the Renegade. These represent attitudes towards technology I have seen and interpreted from people in design, technology and journalism. They discuss problems that occur in the overlap between designer and user with applications that have emerged from the internet in the last decades. The chapters move from a general overview into more specific issues towards the end, inspecting different scales of influence. The influence of the designer is constantly questioned by looking critically at problems, as well as their solutions.  

##As I Walk Through the Silicon Valley
Silicon Valley is world leader of big commercial technology companies. These companies’ impact on daily activity is substantial. Data is traded with cooperations and passed through to government for surveillance. On the personal level, a new ideal of success has come to be, where technological mastery equals progress. How does that ideal influence design and does it work?   

##Big Complex Web
The systems supporting and supported by the internet are an enormous new reality. In looking at technology, understanding or not understanding the driving forces is a new problem. Users are being kept in the unknown with extremely simplified interfaces. At the same time, the back-end (supporting systems) are so complex that their makers start to develop a new, more biological attitude towards it. How do designers deal with this new complexity?  

##Filter Troubles
Social media are the human heart of the internet’s technological body. The characters discuss and compare Reddit and Facebook in order to weigh their pros and cons. Personalization means less personal influence over what one sees but is at the same time impossible to avoid. Looking also at the histories of how these two social networks emerged, paradoxes emerge and raise the question how an online community should be designed.  

##Fleeting Time
For a long time, researchers have been discussing whether internet addiction should be considered real. Whether this is the case remains unclear. In interface design however, designers oftentimes use techniques that provoke behaviours which come back in other addictions. The characters discuss and compare multiple tools and movements that have been designed to help users in their struggle with online media use.

##Self Sufficient
Personal efficiency has been fueled on by services from the internet. A look into two products in the food industry offers again some paradoxes of influence. This time the product and its consumers. First is a powder food replacement which is designed to be as efficient as possible for the human body and is also developed for a more sustainable future of food. Second is Amazon’s Dash project, an internet of things application which lets consumers order food with the push of one button. The optimization advantages of both are discussed. What is better for users? What allows user influence?
