Hi!

# INTRODUCTION

At the core of this research is an obsession. It is an obsession. My obsession with the internet. And your obsession with it. That is the first reason for me to write this essay. I am completely obsessed by the possibilities of the medium but at the same time skeptical about how it is used. 

Only a short 22 years after its launch to a public audience,[^wiki] the internet has made its way firmly into our lives. The transition from an offline to an online world is pretty complete right now. At least here in Europe, at least here in the Netherlands, where in 2014, the internet penetration rate was 94.9%.[^rate] 

Users and providers interests clash constantly. What is best for Google might not be best for you, and vice versa. But we _are_ interdependent. We have to keep living life with technology. At this point it has become essential to our lives. It's not to be ignored. Rather, we should be taking a much closer look into some of the technologies that drive our societies.

A lot of development of the internet originates from the United States. The land of the American Dream. I want to take a peek into their world. Without ever having been there, I think I know something about this crazy place. I want to test that. 

I want to question the upwards spiral of technological advancement. If any. It influences daily lives of us all, whether it's first hand or second hand. I want to look specifically at the influence the tech industry has in this story. With the tech industry I mean the industry that develops goods, software, services and platforms on the internet. Often free for us to use. The industry that has Silicon Valley as its Jerusalem. This industry is key to designers because it fundamentally shapes tools that we work with. And more than that. No software, no platform, no service, no device is without ideology.

I am not an ultimate expert of the internet. But I am also going to try to look at these problems from engineering points of view, playing a kind of technological etymology.

There are some ultimate experts of the internet. They know about obscure things, things like packet switching and network sniffing. Regular users aren't ultimate experts. You, me. But though we might not know how everything works behind the screens, we're the ones that know what we want from it. We can identify failure or success without looking at any review, rating, or performance measure. But: users are being kept in the dark about how things work. Users are being pushed into a spectator role. I think that should change. We should become a bit more like the ultimate experts. 

Maybe this is where the designer comes in. The designer is both a user of technology as well as a shaper of content and interface on digital platforms. 

I tried to do a general take on the internet. I failed miserably. But in the process, I've found out a lot of things about the daily technologies that we use. How we react to them, who makes them, how communities form, what's done by people and what's done by machines. 

I will adopt three recurring ways of speaking to present my research. They are three characters. The characters represent opinions and attitutes from interviews and talks fused with articles, documentaries and my own personal experience.

I do this mainly because in personal experience there is always the first-person perspective, the world through a filter, shaped by experience. It is that kind of view of the problems posed here that I want to expand. 

The way we read online is different from the book in the way that it usually involves more people. A Wikipedia article is a crowd-based piece of information, groups of people make articles appear in your feed and comment sections show instant discussion between readers.

This form is a way of showing different attitudes towards the internet from a user-designer point of view.

# Characters

The characters go by the screen names of Gonzo, Optimo and the Renegade.

Gonzo is in his mid twenties. Based in The Hague (NL), he dropped out of design school and a Computer Science college degree to work on his art. Child of a mother and father that are supportive of his life choices. He has a job working at an electronics store. Via a message board for app developers he met Optimo.

Optimo is a man, 32 years old. He lives and works in Amsterdam as a Human Resources manager for the public transport company of the city. In his spare time he enjoys going for a run or visiting galleries in the city. And most of all he likes to spend time on little programming projects. On the message board, Optimo and Gonzo also meet The Renegade. 

The Renegade is the hardest one to reach. No one really knows who she is but she has been a moderator of the forum for more than 20 years now. It's known that The Renegade has worked as an engineer in the tech industry of the USA and that she's based in Berlin, with her partner Alex.

This team never met up IRL yet. For a couple of years, they have been discussing developments around Silicon Valley and technological innovation via a message board. They're looking in from the outside and are looking for ideas to pick up and make into a common project. But they always disagree. What follows are some of their discussions.

<footer></footer>#Abstract

This thesis is a scripted discussion between three characters: Gonzo, Optimo and the Renegade. These represent attitudes towards technology I have interpreted from people in design, technology and journalism. They discuss problems that occur in the overlap between designer and user with applications that have emerged from the internet in the last decades. The chapters move from a general overview into more specific issues towards the end of the thesis, inspecting different scales of influence. The influence of the designer is constantly questioned by looking critically at problems, as well as their proposed solutions.  

##As I Walk Through the Silicon Valley
Silicon Valley is world leader with its big commercial technology companies. These companies’ impact on daily life is substantial. Data is traded with cooperations and passed through to government for surveillance. On the personal level, a new ideal of success has come to be, where technological mastery equals progress. How does that ideal influence design and does it work?   

##Big Complex Web
The systems supporting and supported by the internet are an enormous new reality. In looking at technology, understanding or not understanding the driving forces is a new problem. Users are being kept in the unknown with extremely simplified interfaces. At the same time, the back-end (supporting systems) are so complex that their makers start to develop a new, more biological attitude towards it. How do designers deal with this new complexity?  

##Filter Troubles
Social media are the human heart of the internet’s technological body. The characters discuss and compare Reddit and Facebook in order to weigh their pros and cons. Personalization means less personal influence over what one sees but is at the same time impossible to avoid. Looking also at the histories of how these two social networks emerged, paradoxes emerge and raise the question how an online community should be designed.  

##Fleeting Time
For a long time, researchers have been discussing whether internet addiction should be considered real. Whether this is the case remains unclear. In interface design however, designers oftentimes use techniques that provoke behaviours which come back in other addictions. The characters discuss and compare multiple tools and movements that have been designed to help users in their struggle with online media use.

##Self Sufficient
Personal efficiency has been fueled on by services from the internet. A look into two products in the food industry offers again some paradoxes of influence. This time the product and its consumers. First is a powder food replacement which is designed to be as efficient as possible for the human body and is also developed for a more sustainable future of food. Second is Amazon’s Dash project, an internet of things application which lets consumers order food with the push of one button. The optimization advantages of both are discussed. What is better for users? What allows user influence? # As I walk through the Silicon Valley

The three characters together map out the sphere of influence of Silicon Valley. 
 
OPT:  
So, Silicon Valley is located in the South bay of San Francisco, California. Computer chips used to be developed and manufactured there. They are made from silicon, hence the name. The production of chips has since long moved away from Silicon Valley but what stayed were the high-tech companies. Silicon Valley is now a booming ecosystem of startup companies. And, GAFAM are all based in Silicon Valley.

![siliconmaps.com is a commercial party that maps out the tech climate. Pay to put your company on the map.](../../img/silicon-maps.png)

GAFAM?

GAFAM is a term coined by Bruce Sterling, a design critic and writer of cyberpunk novels. In the design discourse, since the beginning of the internet, people have been looking for words and ways to describe the internet. He argued in 02014[^stewart] that it doesn't make sense to still talk about _the internet_[^sterling] but that we should instead talk about Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft (GAFAM): Silicon Valley's giant technology corporations. 

OPT:  
That makes perfect sense. Software originating from the Silicon Valley is distributed across the globe and influences how we work, play and think. And more than that. It's a place of technological innovation which is connected to almost all aspects of life. Business, healthcare, travel, leisure, marketing. 

The reach of Silicon Valley is world wide. The geographic place doesn't matter much. More so do the ideals that come from it. This because a lot of people are looking at the Silicon Valley culture as an example for their businesses. 

![02009 brought the first corporate cultural code of Silicon Valley. The slideshow (in jargon called a ‘slide deck’) has been viewed over 15 million times and outlines Netflix's culture, which is focused on High Performance.](../../img/netflix-culture.png)

The American Dream, a climate with lots of competition, little government support, I'm not really sure what to attribute the American individualism to, but I think it's very obvious in the culture of Silicon Valley. There seems to be a large focus on personal development. That anyone can be anything.

OPT:  
There is a big startup culture. A startup is actually nothing more than a beginning company, but as a term has come to stand for a small and fast-growing business. Lots of startups in the technology sector compete for a place in the market. And because technology is big business, there is a lot of money to be won. The pace of business is high. 

These startups are often funded with money from Venture Capitalists or Angel Investors. In short, Venture Capitalists are bigger institutions that invest money in technology companies. Angel Investors are individuals, usually with some senior experience in the field, who back the company with their money and can act as a kind of business mentor.

I see Silicon Valley as the Hollywood of technology. It's fast, there is a high concentration of superstars of their field, it is a place where there is constant innovation and competition, and so on. It's also comfortably situated on the West Coast of the United States. Its export product is technology where Hollywood exports movies. And while movies were already of a huge influence on our culture, the technology wave is undoubtedly even more succesful. 

## BEER IS CHEAP

In Silicon Valley there is a strong belief that startups can disrupt the market. Disruption is a marketing term where your product changes the market completely instead of just competing with the existing products or services on that market.

When Dan Lyons[^lyons] got laid off from his job as a journalist he made the switch to one of the unicorn startups he'd been writing about. A unicorn startup is a startup valued over 1 billion US dollars. The name unicorn comes from the rare nature of this occurance.[^unicorn]  Being in his fifties, he was a bit of an outsider in this young company and his short-lived experience resulted in the book _Disrupted: My Misadventure In The Start-up Bubble_. The bubble in the title describes two things: first the valuation bubble and second the filter bubble that surrounds the startup world. 

The valuation bubble: In the last ten years, the amount of tech unicorns has raised enormously. The company Lyons was working for was losing money, while being valued as a unicorn. And at the same time, employees were getting free beer and a fun working environment. Lyons asks a colleague how it's possible the company loses money, and yet is handing out free beers.

You're running a company that is never going to make money. You need a lot of cheap labor. You hire people right out of school and feed them a story about a big mission and put them in quite low level jobs. And you give them beer. 

You burn 'em out and churn 'em out. You recruit young people for their fresh skills. But they are lead on and never get any real benefits. For the company, beer is cheap but ownership in the company is valuable. So this is the Venture Capitalists wet dream, but it's not so good for the employees.

![Video still from Silvio Lorusso's <em>Fake It Till You Make It</em>[^fake-it] that shows footage of two start-up founders that both were driven entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and both committed suicide while leading their tech startup.](../img/Fake-it.png)

He has his concerns about how Silicon Valley hires and treats people. That's made possible by the filter bubble: In 02009 Netflix's culture code was lauded by Cheryl Sandberg of Facebook as “may be the most important document ever to come out of the Valley.”[^netflix-cult] It put emphasis on the company as “a team, not a family.” Every position in the company needs a star player. So if you're not performing, you're out. The old idea of job security doesn't apply. 

Am I the only one that thinks this is worrying? 

Maybe, because companies all over the world are looking at Silicon Valley as a market leader, as an example to look up to and learn from.

REN:  
You would love this guy. Silvio Lorusso is an Italian designer who observes the new defaults of entrepreneurialism.[^work-ethic] He maintains a blog where he playfully yet seriously describes new working conditions. The group of workers he describes is not limited to Silicon Valley. It's world wide and he calls this the entreprecariat. The entreprecariat is not one thing. Rather, it's a force field around the conditions of entrepreneurialism and the precariat. He studies the conditions of people in this condition and made this statement to describe what he thinks we should / could do about it.

>We need to take advantage of wit, irony and sarcasm to recombine our collective understanding of precarious conditions. This is what the entreprecariat should be about.

## IN THE HANDS OF DEFAULT SETTERS

GAFAM and startup Silicon Valley hold the default settings to a large part of the internet.

REN:  
It wasn't always like that. Still now users have loads of influence. I think in the beginning of the internet, people were customizing everything more. They wanted to touch every page with their own style. The whole idea of stylesheets[^stylesheets] was to have a _personal_ stylesheet which you could use on every page on the internet. Instead, pages would start to offer their own stylesheets. And after that stylistic power has been moved from the individual user to the provider, new standards came to be which we are now happily accepting, _because they work_.

OPT:  
Of course defaults go way beyond just the looks of a website. In fact, that's only the first place you see it happening. One of the places where defaultism turns out harmful instead of helpful is in the User Agreement.[^hoback] That legal document that pops up when you install software or make online purchases. It's full of important information about what data providers are gathering and what they are allowed to do with it. 

Nobody reads it because the texts are long, full of formalities, et cetera. Silicon Valley has found out one thing soon enough: when you want to do something evil, wrap it into something boring. And so with the promise of free service, you accept. But to what? You don't know. That kind of default can be really harmful. An extraordinary example of this practice was Gamestation.co.uk's 02010 April Fool's prank.[^soul] They added some text to their User Agreement that transfers the user's soul to the company. 

![<em>“By placing an order via this web site on the first day of the fourth month of the year 02010 Anno Domini, you agree to grant Us a non transferable option to claim, for now and for ever more, your immortal soul.”</em> (painting: <em>Dark Night of the Soul</em> by Vincent van Gogh)](img/dark-night-of-the-soul.jpg)

In this case, 7500 people transferred their souls, free of charge. Of course, this is a funny prank, but it also shows we have no idea what we're signing for. This is a scary idea as a user.

In the organ donation business, an opt-out pattern means that you are by default a donor and you have to actively register if you don't want to be a donor. In practice, an opt-out pattern means that a lot more people will donate their organs.[^organs] Summing up, it's important to see what kind of standards and defaults are being introduced to us, may that be ex- or implicitly. And even if it's an explicit default, like the user agreement, there might be something we've failed to read. It's key to read and look critically at what's offered. It's also 🔑 to keep sniffing around and seeing what's really happening in the hands of default setters. 

GON:  
Silicon Valley as the capital of the Land of the Semi-Free and the Home of the Business-Savy.

OPT:
What's up guys, it's Optimo, and today we're going to talk about self-optimization!

##Soylent

REN:   
Hey, I was talking to my friend who eats this stuff called Soylent. Have any of you tried it?

GON:  
Soylent, the powder that replaces food! Not a big fan. Also it's not available in the Netherlands for now. I'll stick to my mom's boerenkool for now.

OPT:  
Yeah, I'm using it sometimes. Soylent can replace regular food. It comes in a powder to be mixed up with water and contains all of the nutrients a human body needs. If I am in a rush or uninspired to cook, this stuff helps.

REN:  
So, I hear it's also a sustainable solution for the future of food. My first reaction was that if everyone would eat this food, the entire planet could be very well off. 

GON:  
What is the secret of Soylent Green? 😈 [^people]

OPT:  
Nice, Gonzo. The Soylent Green movie is actually based on a sci-fi novel from 01966 called _Make Room! Make Room!_.[^room] That book introduced a version of NYC in which overpopulation caused people to resort to Soylent (soy and lentil) and water on ration. The Soylent Green film took a more macabre turn, where Soylent turned out to be made out of humans. 

![](img/make-room.jpg)

All jokes aside though. I know it plays into the sentiment of science fiction. But science is also what makes this stuff possible. Rob Rhinehart – the guy behind Soylent – has a vision of what he calls a world after food. He wants to make it independent from agriculture, eventually. When agriculture doesn't scale[^scalable-backlink] with human needs, which he says will happen, this could be the thing to replace it. So it's not just convenient, it's also a step towards a solution for future food problems. According to a report called _How To Feed The World 2050_,[^feed] the world will have 9.1 billion citizens that need food. We're going to need to improve things and optimize things and a lot of that comes from science and technology. Soylent is made on the formula of nutritional value per dollar and it is very cost-effective.  

GON:  
Wow. You make it sound like this food will solve all the world's problems. What about the pleasure of eating? Won't you lose that? I've heard Soylent is kind of tasteless. I think this only works if you care purely about the nutritional values and not societal values, like building friendships by enjoying a dinner together.

OPT:  
Yeah, that's true. I think the early adopters of this product see food as a resource or a fuel instead of an experience. And that's totally fine. I think you shouldn't see it as a replacement for food, but rather an addition to your regular diet. Like Rob Rhinehart says, Soylent takes care of my needs through the week and I can eat well on the weekends. There hasn't been such a complete food alternative in the past and now it's also open to development for people that are using it themselves. Online, people are making their own versions of Soylent, which are totally customized to their personal needs.[^diy] 

REN:  
I think they're on to something. Food habits have always changed. Why wouldn't we cheer this on? If the alternative is more McDonalds, which has proven to be unhealthy and unsustainable, this is a step in the right direction. 

OPT:  
Right, in an interview with The New Yorker,[^newyorker] Rhinehart also mentions that Soylent should be approached from an open source perspective. When the interviewer asked him if he wasn't afraid the D.I.Y. community would hinder his business, he said that if someone else figures out a better way to make it, that’s still a win for humanity.

The people behind Soylent are using their experiences as computer engineers and scientists to optimize food. In their view, everything is made of parts, everything can be broken down. So they looked just at what chemicals a human body needs and put that into one airtight solution. 

GON:  
This is like the first step into alien territory. All aspects of life are already built to human needs, and Soylent stands for this total solution, which claims to have the answer for all. It's synthetic food, right? That's pretty scary. 

OPT:  
Well, the fact that it's synthetic is the great thing about it! They claim synthetic is better than natural. Synthetic food means it can be optimized for _humans_. Synthetic does not mean plastic, it just means that it is made artificially, instead of naturally. In that perspective it really is better food because it only has what people need, nothing more.

GON:  
I still think it won't win over the world in a day. But hey, I guess it's a great innovation and I'm curious to see where it goes. 

## OBVIOUSLY SMART

OPT:  
It's crazy that, when you order something from Amazon, you never realize the extremely complicated industry behind the process. In front of all of these complex infrastructures are the increasingly simple interfaces and seamless payment procedures. And companies are working hard to keep it that way. The comfort of the user is everywhere a key part of the selling formula. Amazon Dash is probably the most striking example of this.

Dash is a button you order from Amazon. Every button is dedicated to one single product with a specific order size. Once you have the Dash button in your house, one press will order a single serve of that product at Amazon, which will be delivered soon thereafter.

![Never run out of energy.](img/dash-red-bull.jpg) 

People have hacked this little device already to do all sorts of things. From playing a video to setting the mood by dimming lights in the house, to whatever you can imagine a remote control to do.

REN:  
Smarty Pants.

GON:
Alright, let's see. Athos. Raised $35 million[^tech] in November 02015 and are working on smart pants.

> “Athos. Building a better human machine.”  
> Scott Anderson, Director of Athletic Training at Stanford University

A company from the United States called Athos is now selling wearables (wearable technology) that use small EEG sensors to measure muscle activity and give you real-time information about your sports routine. It uses science to convince and athletes to model for their commercials.

![Athos pants](img/athos-pants.png)

Benjamin Bratton is professor of visual arts and director of the center for design and geopolitics at the University of California, San Diego. 

In 02013 he gave a very insightful talk at TEDx San Diego.[^bratton] TED is a non-profit organization that originated in California. They organize conferences where speakers talk about their personal involvement in Technology, Entertainment and Design (T-E-D) and more. Usually a TED speaker will give an insight into a technology they are developing, a project they initiated with a focus how that helps society. The format is key to their existence. Videos have to be under 18 minutes long so they can be uploaded and watched by a big audience online.

Benjamin Bratton used the stage to critique the format TED uses. He argued that TED is not really critical towards technology. Instead, the institution books speakers that tell incredible stories of how technology changes the world while these visions do not always come true. He calls this ‘toying with technoradicalism.’ Bratton says TED has _faith in_ technology but not enough _commitment to_ technology. The institute puts too much emphasis on the optimal condition. It lacks sharp critique.

Instead, Bratton makes a case for design as immunisation. Design, he says, should not only focus on innovation but also on making ourselves immune for the things we don't need.

I don't know if we need the new pants from Athos. But the problem Bratton addresses towards TED and things like wearables and the Internet of Things do make me take a double take. What's the use of knowing exactly what each muscle does? The makers as well as users of technology put heaps of faith in the products, especially when they appear smart.

<footer></footer># BIG, COMPLEX, WEB

The Renegade and Gonzo are amazed by the complexity of the internet. They discuss ways companies handle work behind the screens and wonder if we can learn from that. With Optimo, they talk about the way users and designers can deal with this complexity.

## THE SHAPE OF THE CLOUD

GON:  
The scale of the internet is something mind-boggling. Everytime I use the internet, I'm surprised it works.

REN:  
I agree. The back end is the place where it all happens. What happens there is the really amazing part of the internet. The back end are the hidden processes, the calculations and programs running for front end services.

OPT:  
Tech companies develop products with scalability in mind. Scalability is the ability of a system to become more efficient or optimal when its application grows. Take for example a search engine. The more content it searches, the more interesting the search engine is for its users. Google for ten things is not as useful as Google for a million things, and this becomes more true the bigger we go. How scaling works technically can be extremely complex, so as a user we almost never see processes behind our actions. We see the front end of a process in the shape of an interface, the work happens in The Cloud. 

GON:  
It's so weird they call the back end ‘The Cloud’. That's misleading users: The Cloud is physical. It is server farms, interconnected via cables. I say wireless is only a half-truth when there are strings attached. 

## ROBOTS SERVING HUMANS

OPT:  
I love watching this video[^kiva] of the sorting robots in Amazon's warehouses. How they find their own way through the warehouse is marvelous to see.

<figure id="kiva">

<figcaption>The Kiva robots are a good example of how software has shaped the physical world. These robots are an essential part of the Amazon delivery chain and boost delivery speed.</figcaption>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/quWFjS3Ci7A?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The warehouses no longer store items sorted for humans. Instead, the objects are placed on the shelves according to what is fastest. The system knows what shelves carries which item, the robots carry those shelves to ‘pick-workers’ that take the items out of the shelves and pack them for sending. The robot finds its own way through the warehouse. They can do this without bumping into other robots or human beings. 

This way they can process an order from click to send sometimes in less than 15 minutes. Amazon has 21 million different items for sale. The warehouse needs less walking space, because humans don't need to walk through aisles anymore. This operation is scalable as hell.

You'll see the worker doesn't have to do much of anything anymore. The entire system is developed to make human work as simple as possible.

> “Pick, scan, pack. We try to simplify their life and hide the technology. All Kiva Pick workers are happy pick workers.”
> Mick Mountz, CEO of Kiva Systems [^pick]

![In this image, the effect of the robotic system on the job of an Amazon pick worker is shown. Effectively, the employee only has to reach an arm out, and the robot has brought the item ready for retrieval.](img/amazon-picker.jpg)

REN:  
Wow, I wouldn't want to be one of those. Let me play with the code of those bots, though.

GON:  
Amazing about this is the system itself. It's impressive how they got all of this to run so smoothly. Even though the pick workers have a bit of a boring job, the comparison is easily made with picking stuff from trees, how nice of a job was that? And this means less hard work. Less bending over, reaching, easy money, no? 

## CUBES OR COBWEBS

REN:  
In June 02013, Edward Snowden, who worked for the NSA-affiliated defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton leaked a great amount of files of the USA's National Security Agency's massive surveillance practices. The NSA can spy and did spy on innocent citizens as well as criminals[^nsa] all around the world using back doors to big service providers on the internet.

This is a dark side of a big centralized internet. One part of that darkness is the strong influence of the United States' secret service. Another thing is their access to Silicon Valley's major servers where personal data is stored. Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Skype, you name it. Governments like this centralized power because it's easy access for them.

The structure of the internet hasn't changed much since the beginning. Files are stored on a central server, for instance one from Google. When using Google, all traffic runs through that server and all information is in one place, ready to be intercepted.

![One of the slides of the NSA that Ed Snowden released. Here we see which companies provided data to the NSA](img/prism.jpg) 

REN:  
The root of the problem is the centralized network. The NSA's concentrated power comes in the form of big, cubical server facilities.

An alternative could be a distributed network. A centralized network has a big, centralized server infrastructure where all the data and files are stored. A decentralized system doesn't have that. There, files are stored on parts of the network. 

I've been following the developments of Bitcoin - a cryptocurrency - and with that, the Blockchain. The Blockchain is a technology that offers a new kind of server infrastructure. There are different possibilities, but one example could be: All nodes in the network store a full copy of all transactions on that network while all relevant files and data can stay on individual drives.[^blockchains] This allows a distributed network. One without a middle man.

It allows for new beginnings, and a new type of internet which is more distributed is harder to control centrally by one or a handful of parties.

GON:  
Alright, all this is fine and dandy, but what if I know that the technical stuff is very complicated, but I don't care. I just want them to not snoop in? 

REN:  
This is exactly why setting up things like distributed networks is so important. When ugly things are happening online, we need safe places where activists, journalist, dissidents, whistleblowers and such can have free discussion online. And that should not be so complex that you need to be a coding wizard to understand, because anybody could be stuck in that position and anyone should be able to defend themselves online.

## MONKEYS AND MESSINESS

GON:  
I still have no idea how the internet works exactly, but I'm starting to see some patterns. I have the idea not one person really knows how the entire thing actually works.

REN:  
I think for the internet itself, there are some experts that probably know exactly how the protocols work and so on. But we shouldn't always rely on others for understanding the things we use.  It's one thing to say that there is an expert somewhere that knows what's going on and we let them do the understanding. But more and more there is no such expert. 

A good example is when a big service is being built there is this thing called The _Change Review Board_. It can be 12 people there, who all have their specialty. One for the network part of things, one for storage, one for application development, et cetera. When they make changes to their parts, they have to state them out loud to the other 11 people in the room to see if that does not interfere with something in their ‘worlds’. They simply don't know! The same people come together when something fails, to find the problem. Can you imagine that? Optimo?

OPT:  
Is it okay for me to freak out a little bit over that? I like to be in control of my own. Is there no hope anymore to control more by yourself?

REN:  
I think not. A lot of programming is now what we call procedural. That means the programmer has to predict enough states so the computer can do the calculation. _If_ this happens, _do_ that. That's fairly straightforward. With deep learning or Artificial Intelligence comes another, probabilistic reasoning system. If I see this input, I _think_ I should do that. The computer starts learning and guessing by itself.

Computers were exact precise things, but now we have huge, often messy systems. People have a low tolerance for error for anything that comes out of a computer. That should change when we start to see that they are also biological. Humans are already conditioned to accept complexity that's unavoidable. If a doctor tells you that weird itch won't go away, you learn to accept it, at least a bit. I wonder if we get to the same point with computers.

I think we should go towards a biological thinking approach. These things are very complex. They've evolved over time and have this organic messiness. We need to focus much more on the details of the subsystems (like studying cells in biology). The details of a component in the hope of creating a broader picture. The details really matter. 

This is where it also gets interesting for users. We're talking about the back end, but I think it's time for people to learn more about the biological forces behind their devices and entertainment. After all, they must be wondering how this all can be. Now, luckily people are usually much smarter than I think and do they have an idea. But it's not often that we hear more detailed accounts of back end services.

Google pioneered 'continuous failure'. It is not a question if the system will fail, but when.[^a16z] They are one of the first to design their back end in a biological way because of this.

One favorite example which mimics biological life is The Chaos Monkey. The Chaos Monkey randomly takes pieces of the server down and sees how it responds. The idea is to lower the gap between how Netflix expects the system to work and how the system actually works. In biology this is how you learn about a living thing. Actively trying to mutate it is a biological technique.

![Netflix' Simian Army](img/simian-army.png)

There seem to be a couple of ways of dealing with big computing. We can either freak out or say this is so complicated and are amazed to a point where we can only watch. Both of those cut off questioning. 

We need to recognize that it is okay not to always understand. We have to constantly keep trying to understand and should be excited by trying to understand. We have to realize things are messy but also that it's something we created. 

Regular users should also know that all of our technology can fail. The world is a beta test, no technology is ever fully finished. Alpha's have had their time. More diversity and more failures for more commitment. We are in a way the problem of the tech because of impatience. In order to help ourselves, we should have a better understanding of technology in society. These should move towards each other instead of keeping users in the dark about what happens behind the screen. That way, we can have useful discussion.

<footer></footer># Filter Troubles 

Optimo and the Renegade discuss the  politics of filtering content on social media. Gonzo dreams of exploring new horizons.

REN:  
A community is usually something that forms over time. Friendships grow, relationships are built up and broken down in smooth motions. There can be a kind of natural organization. In online communities there is a whole deal of building, guiding and optimizing. That's fundamentally different. It means we have influence from the bottom up. Me personally, I'm a big fan of Reddit.[^reddit] It's a social news platform spanning about every topic you can imagine.

OPT:  
I never got around to using Reddit. The interface isn't comfortable for me.

REN:  
It takes some patience to get into it. Reddit has an interesting history. When you say Reddit, you have to say Aaron Swartz, who was one of its founders. As a teenager he was already involved in developing internet technologies like the web feed format RSS and the Markdown publishing format. He cared deeply about the impact the internet has on society and the freedoms it could support. Swartz set up the Creative Commons License together with law professor Lawrence Lessig and wrote the _Guerilla Open Access Manifesto_.[^manifesto]

>Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for
themselves.

While studying at MIT, Swartz had access to the JSTOR database. Swartz believed this knowledge should be available for everyone. He went into the server room of the institute and copied the data on a hard drive. 

![Swartz in the JSTOR Server Room](img/aaron-swartz.png)

The FBI knew Swartz from another case where he published legal documents of PACER.[^pacer] When they suspected him of wanting to publish JSTOR documents the FBI installed a camera in the server room and caught him red handed. He then got overcharged for his crime: 35 years of jail time awaited him. He hung himself under the pressure, leaving no note.  

Aaron Swartz called himself a sociologist. In one of many blog posts[^blog] he writes that criticizing culture is too superficial. Instead you have to look at the institutes that shape culture. So let's take Reddit and compare that to Facebook,[^facebook] the platform become institute. The one nearly everyone seems to use.

## The Front Page of the Internet or the Social Utility That Connects You With Other People Around You

REN:  
Almost all of Reddit's posted content comes directly from users. A subbreddit is a community that is dedicated to one particular interest. You decide which subreddits you subscribe to. There are human moderators looking over their subreddits to keep order. Content can be up- or downvoted by users. The order of content in your feed is sorted by explicit votes from users. There is a special feed for controversy, where posts with a close up and down ratio are shown.

OPT:  
So how does Facebook filter their content?

REN:  
Where Reddit's content is filtered by people in a fairly direct way, Facebook uses algorithms. Facebook's feed works with an algorithm called EdgeRank.[^edge] Every story, post, or interaction on Facebook is a so called Edge. Each Edge gets a value that is based on three things. Affinity score, weight and time. In practice, this means that each post is competing for a spot in your news feed. Already in 02007, 60 out of 30,000 possible stories were shown daily to users of Facebook.[^wow]

Facebook specialized this personalization process over the years. It's so good they had to start randomizing the process more because people were creeped out by the precision of the feed. The company furthermore is very keen on personalizing more than just the feed. Advertisements, location based content, third parties' apps, they all work with pre-knowledge of your behaviours as user. 

From a design point of view, the following is key: While Facebook boasts that it is _people-centric_,[^people] Reddit does a much better job at _involving_ people. Facebook is comfortable, slick, personalized. Reddit less so, but it the user has more personal influence on what he/she sees. That influence makes the user feel like an explorer, not a spectator.

Boldly put, Facebook trusts technology while Reddit trusts in people. As a designer these trust issues come up when developing digital media. Designers are always working for someone. The goal should not be to always please the people with the money, but to empower those who have vision, and to be a part of making something meaningful to people on a personal, not corporate scale. 

In the end, Reddit does a much better job at connecting people and building an online community in the sense that the people using it aren't left feeling trapped or tricked by their own browsing behaviour, which happens more often in Facebook's community. The old design credo “Less is more” is applicable here in the way that less influence from above gives people more freedom to explore. Ironically, our close friends are connected via Facebook while we meet unknown people by common interest on Reddit. 

## The Dérive

GON:  
This reminds me of something. Guy Debord, an artist from the international Situationist movement from the '50s on, defined the action of the dérive.[^derive] Literally translating to _drift_, the dérive is a method of getting lost, wandering aimlessly for periods ranging from several hours to several days or even weeks, only guided by urban space and observing the psychological states it invokes. It is a way of studying the emotional effects the city has. He called this _psychogeography_.[^psychogeography] 

![A number of findings from the dérive were bundled into an anti-book in collaboration with Asger Jorn. The anti-book covers were made out of sandpaper, destroying every book that came in contact with it.](../img/anti-book.jpg)

REN:  
If you would dérive on Facebook, wouldn't it be infinitely less interesting than in the city? There is no way of escaping your own influence, unlike the city where you can be anonymous. You would get stuck in loops of familiar people, familiar stories and links. 

GON:  
Not entirely. I think the dérive could get new life in the digital context. Debord mentions the narrow experience citizens have of the city of Paris. The dérive is used to escape exactly that. Scrolling down the news feed is a type of wandering that is guided by Facebook's intentions. This _is_ the narrow experience that needs escaping. Imagine ‘going out’ online like you would IRL. Not to another party, but to another social media service. Your Instagram gang visiting the world of Reddit.

And it is getting easier to change the behaviour of your personal Facebook experience. I'm using this tool recently for Facebook called F.B. Purity. I like the idea of it. You can block certain keywords from your newsfeed and customize how Facebook looks. It looks very old school though, and Facebook's interface is always changing so the tool can be pretty buggy.

<figure id="fbpurity">

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VdNHiqOi2M?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

REN:  
Yeah, but it does what you want. You can't always judge a tool just on the looks or user-friendliness. The people making that stuff usually do it on their own time and without any payment from anyone! This developer is focussing on the essentials for it to keep it working. If you think about it, it's kind of amazing. He's like a little David against Facebook Goliath.

OPT:  
No, I think I'd never use that. User experience is key. It takes me too much time to manually add the list items. I want someone or something to do that for me. I use another tool called Detox[^detox] when I want to work. It fills my feed with news from selected sources so when I do flip over to Facebook, I won't get distracted by the daily food-shot of my neighbour.

GON:   
You gotta love these efforts, right? Hail the clumsy solutions, the hacks and stooges.

REN:  
I like the F.B. Purity more than Detox. Detox seems cool but only works as a replacement. Purity let's you customize the entire feed. It's underground and independent. 

Funny though, that also while a lot of parties try to make a profit online, there are so many free solutions to the problems that come with that. And the design solutions that used to be clumsy have become much more professional. As the corporate internet grows more professional, so do its counter-movements.

<footer></footer>#The Parable of Sweating Mark Zuckerberg

Mark Zuckerberg outsmarted his private coding tutors since the '90s without breaking a sweat. In high school Mark Zuckerberg was the captain of his fencing team. Sweating was something you did behind the mask, faceless, or after the action. Mark Zuckerberg sat cool and dry in his dormitory in 2004 when he launched TheFacebook. Early summer 2007 and Mark Zuckerberg still kept his cool even as he sat in court weighed on by accusations of stealing the idea for Facebook.  

But at the All Things Digital conference in 2010, Mark Zuckerbergs armpits were sweating in his hoodie. Sat in the hot seat, he answered questions about Facebook’s privacy issues.

“Why don’t you take off the hoodie?” — Facebook started out as so much fun, he thought, but it just got so big, and now he was responsible for so many people. He didn’t know where to look. “But I never take off the hoodie.” — “Well, can you explain what this instant personalization thing is about?” — Making the world more open and connected, sweating Mark Zuckerberg thought. How naïve, he thought. “Maybe I should take off the hoodie.” 

It’s okay, sweating Mark Zuckerberg. Take it off. We all sweat sometimes.#Fleeting Time

The cast wonders if their use of online media is an addiction. 

REN:  
What do you think, can you call social media an addiction?

OPT:  
Yes, I think so.

GON:  
I don't know, it's not in the official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) yet, but I would say some media have been made so tempting to use that it's almost impossible not to use them. 

OPT:  
I've been reading about machine gambling in Las Vegas in this book called _Addiction by Design_.[^schull] Natasha Dow Schüll, the author, spent more than 10 years in Las Vegas to explore all kinds of aspects of machine gambling and I keep seeing lots of parallels to the internet. Check it out: developers of machine gambling are always trying to optimize the time people stay on the devices. It doesn't even matter how much they win or lose. As long as they keep coming and come for long amounts of time, the casinos keep making money. 

The crazy thing is that it does not stop there. They are all-inclusive strategies. Using the architecture of the casinos, the layout of the city, everything inside works together to keep people inside. It's a total design.

Later on I learned Dow Schüll[^ivr] felt the same. She saw the parallel between her gambling research in Las Vegas and the digital world. A lot is built into the design of user interfaces.[^magic] The slot machine comparison can be seen almost literally in some apps. What prize is behind this button? How many likes do I get when I post this? Everything is gamified.

REN:  
I've actually heard doubts being raised if students that use laptops can actually learn something. Joelle Renstrom, an English literature teacher at [^glazed]

OPT:  
I think you should see this. It's called _Time Well Spent_[^well] This is a design movement that want to align our technology with our humanity. These people recognize the problem that our media is trying to claim our attention and they offer some solutions.

They make an important division between attention companies and platform companies. The attention companies are for instance Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and Netflix and the platformers are companies such as Google and Apple. The former needs to maximize attention to make money, the latter are builders of the interfaces that sit between the applications and us. 

The attention companies profit from our screentime, so they won't change. While the platformers should be the party that benefits users more than companies since they are the moderators of the interactions we have with technologies.

All the time we are being distracted we have the feeling that it's our own mistake, but it's easy to forget that attention companies have loads of marketing employees working for them called 'Growth Hackers.' Their job is to maximize T.O.D.

![Addicts of slot machines often report a feeling of being in “the zone”. They describe the feeling as ‘becoming one’ with the machine.](img/the-zone.png)

Probably everyone has had at least some glimpse of The Zone.

There are a lot of strategies they use to maximize your attention, which will gain them profits. One very simple and common hook is the Intermittent Variable Reward. This means sometimes you get a nice reward, and other times you don't. This kind of behaviour is easy to program because you already do receive messages. How they hook people in, is by making sure there are more notifications to keep you playing the loop. These strategies are very invasive, and make very conscious abuse of some concepts from psychology and science behind addiction and distraction.

GON:  
If you come to see it from this perspective, the whole internet seems pretty awful. All big services are using these kind of techniques! But I have to say there is a kind of dark pleasure in binging out on things like Netflix or Youtube. I have to go in sometimes and not come out for a while. Everything is shiny, everything smiles, there are rewards everywhere, why wouldn't I like that? It gets in the way of working or studying, but sometimes that's exactly what I want.

In a skit from John Cleese’s training videos called _Why do people work?_[^cleese] he portrays a typical sixties factory worker in the UK. As he stands there in his wife-beater he complains about an occurrence that happened to him that morning. He got approached by a man that asked him questions about job satisfaction. As an answer, he reminds the suit that all he does the entire day is a repetitive task. Push the button, pull the lever, check the reading. After 200 years of industrial innovation, he says, this is what he does. He goes on about motivation. The only motivation is the pay-check, that allows him to do spend money on things he loves. The entire time the camera is panned in on his face and upper body against a monotone background. All the while talking, he has been pushing the button, pulling the lever and checking the reading, but by the time he has finished his rant, the camera pans out and we realize that the button and lever belong to a slot machine. 

Leaves me with the question, what do we want to do? We're also clueless actually. Maybe we're actually very thankful for these devices. Easy to kill time, no?

REN:  
Well, in my early days I would also spend entire days messing with a PC and a program, trying to hook all things up. That took most of my time and I could get lost in it, but there was still a personal responsibility, I had to cooperate with the computer to get where i wanted to get. I don't know. I think designers should just follow their own perspectives and personalize these things much more. If you ask me there is just not enough diversion. we've put the responsibility to answer all of our questions with GAFAM even though we've always known they're big corporations. Get over the fact that their services suck. Of course they're annoying, they are trying to sell you something. 

> Life is pain, princess, anyone trying to tell you differently is trying to sell you something  
> Farmboy[^farmboy]

OPT:  
Sure, that may be the case. But the point is not if an individual makes that choice or not. The point here is that everyone has to deal with these media. And they're not based on the best interests of their users. And when we might transition to some new kind of media, it would be best if we keep in mind these destructive patterns for people. The new architecture of systems should be free of these disgusting addiction hooks.

Protecting people's time is as important as things like privacy.

Look, I'm just pleading for Time Well Spent because they make a good point. Their aim is to develop a more intentional relationship to our devices. The solutions put forward by _Time Well Spent_ are pretty straightforward. Time Well Spent is going towards design that does 'well' to people. They use their knowledge of Google and other companies to make a suggestion for improvement.

REN:  
Well, looking at their site, they offer apps to solve problems with apps. Semi-solutions to real problems. Relying on tech for tech. That does not solve the original problem, it is a way out.

OPT:  
I think that's easy to say. The hard thing is how do you deal with these things while still on the media? I'm using Selfcontrol[^selfcontrol] sometimes. It blocks access to pages I enter in my blacklist.

GON:  
Moment[^moment] is the mobile version of that. Crazy how you can see all of those tech companies supporting that tool, right? It's pretty strange.

OPT:  
😂. I love these. Have you seen the Distractagone? That one might actually work.

REN:  
No I haven't. Can you explain?

OPT:  
The Distractagone is just a cube-shaped vault with a timer on it. It allows you to keep your phone locked inside for an X period of time. And during that time you are undistracted! It sounds like a great idea.

But isn't this a forced solution? It's like hiding candy from children. That's never stopped them from taking the candy if they really wanted it. 

GON:  
Yeah, I think that's a very important thing to stress. No matter how many tools and thingamajingeys you use, if you are sensitive to these impulses you don't stand a chance against yourself. I mean, I'm using this Selfcontrol thing on a schedule. That means I can never go on Facebook but hell, I also installed a proxy so I can go there anytime anyways. I also have an iPhone laying on my desk, which has another blocking app installed but for that one I also know how to break it.

OPT:  
I talked to Charlie Stigler, the guy that programmed Selfcontrol.[^stigler] It seems fitting that he himself does not have any problems dealing with the problems a lot of people report from the attention companies. He mentioned it himself: he doesn't have problems with self-control, he just _has_ self-control. He also mentioned in our interview that 

REN:  
This seems to be a bottom line in many of the problems we've discussed. I think no matter how sophisticated our technologies get, we can get carried away with trying to change our human nature. Everyone reacts to tech in their own way, and it does have its victims. And we'll always remain skeptical.

<footer></footer>#CONCLUSION

In my research I've been all over the place. Now I want to distill some of the things I've learned.

It was necessary to include Silicon Valley as it's layed the base for a lot of things that will come. Just as TV shows and movies nowadays still use tropes from early Hollywood inventions, tech will keep using lots of the ideas coming from Silicon Valley in the future. 

Designing for the internet, online life. I think it's hard to say. We should do what we think is good. 

I am not cynical about technological advancement. Reading and learning about the powers behind it has however made me much more skeptical about the impact tech has. 

It's been a very USA-centric research, so I hope to learn more in the coming times about other cultures, such as the Asian background in technology.

On the one side, Silicon Valley is big corporate companies with enormous global influence. On the other hand it's the startups, the more messy world with sometimes insane investments and sometimes great innovation. Its culture influences entrepreneurs all around the world. I will keep watching the developments of the states of labour that come from it to learn from the experiences of others. I will always inspect defaults, because implicit defaults have a more profound influence than explicit optional features. 





> Why insist that the changes are over? Artists who begin with the proposition that the phenomena of their world are boring and banal, who begin with an exasperated sigh, are going to produce art that is boring and banal, art that produces exasperated sighs.  
> — Brian Droitcour [^droitcour]


One thing I've really learned while writing these sometimes incoherent pieces of text, is that I am not the only one with my obsession, my obsession with the internet. It's a globally shared obsession for good reason. The technological advancements are big, the consequences for human beings have been far-reaching. Sometimes harmful, oftentimes fixing problems. 




People are often totally self-responsible for what they do and have to design their life with technology. Some pitfalls come from technology that designers, but also just people should be aware of. 



- Oversimplification. Very handy in programming, not so handy IRL (In Real Life). Trust your audience, they have an imagination. They don't read barcodes, they read stories, ideas, jokes. 
- Distraction for the sake of distraction. 
- Reverence of technology is bad, designers come up with ways of demystifying tech! 
- Use tech as your slaves. I think designers are pretty good at this already. Pass that attitude on to users. They know there's more to life than likes. 
- Design as immunisation: Actively prevent quasi-innovations from happening.
- Be subversive to big systems but learn from them. It can be useful to see Google as your enemy from time to time but it doesn't make sense to blame them for all the problems in the world.
- Approach new services with distrust and keep checking what free services get from you. Some things are not made in your best interest. 
- Ennui principle: Build up and release.
- Use the dérive as an inspiration. Go with the flows of the stream and find all that good stuff.
- Always keep messing with things, no matter how big or boring.

I'm going to sign off for a bit now. All this internet talk has left me stupid, unreflective, overloaded. But I'll sharpen my typing nails and be back in a day or two. Or less.

#AFTERWORD

I just want to give this little bit of Benjamin Bratton for you:

> At a societal level, the bottom line is that if we invest in things that make us feel good but which don't work, don't invest in things which don't make us feel good, but which may solve problems, then our fate is that in the long run it will just get harder and harder to feel good about not solving problems.

😪

DESIGN IS JUST A TOOL. IN THE WRONG HANDS IT WILL DO WRONG THINGS. THE SILICON VALLEY OF DISRUPTION DOES NOT HAVE THE ANSWER, BUT LOOKING AT THEM MAY GIVE SOME IDEAS. 

We should be asking what the internet is distracting us from, not how the internet is distracting us. 

For fluff sake, it's going to be a very difficult time for the arts. Right-winged politics took the USA, where Mr. Trump took a country by surprise. The biggest party in the Netherlands is racist and will take a lion's share in next February's election. Geert Wilders made public threats to the Morrocan community, he literally said he would CLEAN SHIP without specifiying what. This is harmful. Politicians need to specify what they mean, empty words lead to confusion. Is there really no alternative for this politics of anger?

The internet's distracted us for a nice run. It was fun on there, but we should also really spend some time with people around us. See what they're up to. See what you can do together to have fun, or to help. 

A diversion into military equipment (what the internet originally was). Disguised by sleek design, tempting with simple interfaces, catchy flashy sexy sensual all of that but what if that doesn't matter anymore and you're not feeling good in the streets? Everybody has a plan until they get hit in the face. By Big data, refugee crises, politicians with terrible haircuts. And all the while we just want to learn to understand our peers better. Whatttttt has it come 2.
