# As I walk through the Silicon Valley

Optimo has been asked to work at a startup company called Athos and is considering moving from Europe to the Valley. The three characters together map out the sphere of influence of Silicon Valley. 
 
GON:  
So, what made the Silicon Valley to such an important center of technology? Why there? 

OPT:  
It's located in the South bay of San Francisco, California. The nickname Silicon Valley comes from the material used to make those chips. 

GON:  
Ghe he. Silicon supports bigger boobs and smaller computer chips. 

OPT:  
ðŸ˜‚ ... The production of chips has since long moved from Silicon Valley â€“ mainly to Asia â€“ but what stayed were the high-tech companies. Silicon Valley is now a booming ecosystem of innovation companies right now. And, GAFAM are all based in Silicon Valley.

GAFAM is a term coined by Bruce Sterling, a design critic and writer of cyberpunk novels. In the design discourse, since the beginning of the internet, people have been looking for words to describe the phenomena. He argued in 02014 that it doesn't make sense to still talk about _the internet_[^sterling] but that we should instead talk about _GAFAM_ â€“ Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft: Silicon Valley's giant technology corporations. 

## CORPORATE CULTURE

REN:  
That makes perfect sense. Software originating from the Silicon Valley is distributed across the globe and influences how we work, play and think. And more than that. It's a place of technological innovation which is connected to almost all aspects of life. Business, healthcare, travel, leisure, marketing. 

The reach of Silicon Valley is world wide. The geographic place matters, but much more so the ideals that come from it. This because a lot of people are looking at the Silicon Valley culture as an example for their businesses. 

The American Dream, a climate with lots of competition, little government support, I'm not really sure what to attribute the American individualism to, but I think it's very obvious in the culture of Silicon Valley. There seems to be a large focus on personal development. That anyone can be anything. That ideal is amazing and attractive. 

And it sells technology very well, because they are good at shaping technology in ways that are very interesting to human beings.

There is a big â€˜startupâ€™ culture. A startup is actually nothing more than a beginning company, but as a term has come to stand for fast-growing. Lots of startups in the technology sector compete for a place in the market. And because technology is big business, there is a lot of money to be won. The pace of business is high. 

In Silicon Valley there is a strong belief that startups can disrupt the market. Disruption is a marketing term where your product changes the market completely instead of just competing with the existing products or services on that market.

These startups are often funded with money from Venture capitalists or Angel Investors. VC's are institutions, Angel Investors are individuals who put their money in the company and act as a kind of business mentor.

I see Silicon Valley as the Hollywood of technology. It's also comfortably situated on the West Coast of the United States. Its export product is technology where Hollywood exports movies. And while movies were already of a huge influence on our culture, the technology wave is undoubtedly even more succesful. 

One man[^lyons] described the corporate culture as one where fun is an important part of the workplace. And while lots of great, sustainable and innovative things have come 

Silicon valley the show

The startup culture is subject of much media attention. Demographics [^work-ethic]

REN:  
Optimo, you should question if you want to work in this way. I think it's bad to overly focus on growth.

## IN THE HANDS OF DEFAULT SETTERS

We users say we want influence, but we mainly want everything to just work. We want consistent, working design. 

In the beginning of the internet, people were customizing everything. They wanted to touch every page with their own style. The whole idea of stylesheets[^stylesheets] was to have a _personal_ stylesheet, which you could use on every page on the internet. Instead, pages would start to offer their own stylesheets. And after that stylistic power has been moved from the individual user to the provider, new standards came to be which we are now happily accepting, _because they work_.

:  
Of course defaults go way beyond just the looks of a website. In fact, that's only the first place you see it happening.

One of the places where defaultism is harmful instead of helpful is in the User Agreement[^hoback]. That legal document that pops up when you install software or make online purchases. It's full of important information about what data providers are gathering and what they are allowed to do with it. 

Nobody reads it because the texts are long, full of formalities, et cetera. Silicon Valley has found out one thing soon enough: when you want to do something evil, wrap it into something boring. And so with the promise of free service, you accept. But to what? You don't know. That kind of default can be really harmful. An extraordinary example of this practice was Gamestation.co.uk's 2010 April Fool's prank[^soul]. They added some text to their User Agreement that transfers the user's soul to the company. 

> SHOULD WE WISH TO EXERCISE THIS OPTION, YOU AGREE TO SURRENDER YOUR IMMORTAL SOUL, AND ANY CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ON IT, WITHIN 5 (FIVE) WORKING DAYS OF RECEIVING WRITTEN NOTIFICATION FROM GAMESATION.CO.UK OR ONE OF ITS DULY AUTHORIZED MINIONS.

In this case, 7500 people transferred their souls, free of charge. Here, this is kind of funny, but it also shows we have no idea what our side of the bargain is. This is a scary idea as a user.

GON:  
Yeah, so Silicon Valley is the capital of the Land of the Semi-Free and the Home of the Business-Savy.
