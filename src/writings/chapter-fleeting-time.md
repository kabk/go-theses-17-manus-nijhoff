#Fleeting Time

The cast wonders if their use of online media is an addiction. How to deal with life online?

REN:  
What do you think, can you call social media an addiction?

OPT:  
Yes, I think so.

GON:  
I don't know, it's not in the official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) yet, but I would say some media have been made so tempting to use that it's almost impossible not to. 

OPT:  
I've been reading about machine gambling in Las Vegas in this book called _Addiction by Design_.[^schull] Natasha Dow Schüll spent more than 10 years in Las Vegas to explore all kinds of aspects of machine gambling and I keep seeing lots of parallels to the internet. Check it out: developers of machine gambling are always trying to optimize the time people stay on the devices. It doesn't even matter how much they win or lose. As long as they keep coming and come for long amounts of time, the casinos keep making money. 

The crazy thing is that it does not stop there. They are all-inclusive strategies. Using the architecture of the casinos, the layout of the city, everything inside works together to keep people inside. It's a total design.

Later on I learned Dow Schüll[^ivr] felt the same. She saw the parallel between her gambling research in Las Vegas and the digital world. A lot is built into the design of user interfaces.[^magic] The slot machine comparison can be seen almost literally in some apps. What prize is behind this button? How many likes do I get when I post this? Everything is gamified.

REN:  
I've actually heard doubts being raised if students that use laptops can actually learn something. Joelle Renstrom, an English literature teacher at jhgjhg wrote about[^glazed] her experiences with technology in the classroom. Though her question is a bit dramatic: “Is there any hope left for learning?” I think it's a pretty legitimate thing to worry about. She describes the tendency of technology to distract as a very strong power. 

OPT:  
I think you should see this. It's called _Time Well Spent_[^well] This is a design movement that want to align our technology with our humanity. These people recognize the problem that our tech is constantly trying to claim our attention and they offer some solutions.

They make an important division between attention companies and platform companies. The attention companies are for instance Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat and Netflix and the platformers are companies such as Google and Apple. The former needs to maximize attention to make money, the latter are builders of the interfaces that sit between the applications and us. 

The attention companies profit from our screentime, so they won't change by themselves. And the platformers should be the party that benefits users more than companies since they are the moderators of the interactions we have with technologies.

All the time we are being distracted we have the feeling that it's our own mistake, but it's easy to forget that attention companies have loads of marketing employees working for them called 'Growth Hackers.' Their job is to maximize Time On Device.

![Addicts of slot machines often report a feeling of being in “the Zone”. They describe the feeling as ‘becoming one’ with the machine. Almost everyone that ever touched a smartphone has had at least a glimpse of that Zone.](img/the-zone.png)

There are a lot of strategies they use to maximize your attention, which will gain them profits. One very simple and common hook is the Intermittent Variable Reward. This means sometimes you get a nice reward, and other times you don't. A very convenient plug for this is in the notifications of your phone. 

This kind of behaviour is easy to program because you already receive messages. How they hook people in, is by making sure there are enough notifications to keep you tapping and clicking. These strategies are very invasive, and make very conscious abuse of some concepts from psychology and science behind addiction and distraction.

GON:  
If you come to see it from this perspective, the whole internet seems pretty awful. All big services are using these kind of techniques. But I have to say there is also a kind of dark pleasure in binging out on things like Netflix or Youtube. I have to go in sometimes and not come out for a while.

REN:  
Well, in my early days I would also spend entire days messing with a PC and a program, trying to hook all things up. That took most of my time and I could get lost in it, but there was still a personal responsibility, I had to cooperate with the computer to get where i wanted to get. 

If you ask me there is not enough diversity and too much diversion. we've put the responsibility to answer all of our questions with GAFAM even though we've always known they're big corporations. We should get over the fact that their services hook us in. Of course they're annoying, they are trying to sell us something.

OPT:  
Sure, that may be the case. But the point is not if an individual makes that choice or not. The point here is that everyone has to deal with these media. And they're not based on the best interests of their users. When we might transition to some new kind of media, it would be best if we keep in mind these destructive patterns for people. The new architecture of systems should be free of these disgusting addiction hooks.

I'm just pleading for Time Well Spent because they make a good point. Their aim is to develop a more intentional relationship to our devices, meaning that our intentions should be honored more. The solutions put forward by _Time Well Spent_ are pretty straightforward. Time Well Spent is going towards design that does 'well' to people. They use their knowledge of Google and other companies to make a suggestion for improvement.

REN:  
Well, looking at their site, they offer apps to solve problems with apps. Semi-solutions to real problems. Relying on tech for tech. That does not solve the original problem, it is a way out.

OPT:  
I think that's too easy to say. The hard thing is how to deal with these things while still using them. I'm using an app called Selfcontrol[^selfcontrol] sometimes. It blocks access to webpages I enter in my blacklist.

GON:  
Moment[^moment] is the mobile version of that.

OPT:  
😂. I love these. Have you seen the Distractagone? That one might actually work. The Distractagone is just a cube-shaped vault with a timer on it. It allows you to keep your phone locked inside for an X period of time. And during that time you are undistracted! It sounds like a great idea.

REN:  
But isn't this a forced solution? It's like hiding candy from children. That's never stopped them from taking the candy if they really wanted it. 

GON:  
Yeah, I think that's a very important thing to stress. No matter how many tools and thingamajingeys you use, if you are sensitive to these impulses you don't stand a chance against yourself. I mean, I'm using this Selfcontrol thing on a schedule. That means I can never go on Facebook but hell, I also installed a proxy so I can go there anytime anyways. I also have an iPhone laying on my desk, which has another blocking app installed but for that one I also know how to break it.

OPT:  
I talked to Charlie Stigler, the guy that programmed Selfcontrol.[^stigler] It seems fitting that he himself does not have any problems dealing with the problems a lot of people report from the attention companies. He mentioned it himself: he doesn't have problems with self-control, he just _has_ self-control. He also mentioned in our interview that 

REN:  
This seems to be a bottom line in many of the problems we've discussed. I think no matter how sophisticated our technologies get, we can get carried away with trying to change our human nature. Everyone reacts to tech in their own way, and it does have its victims. And we'll always have to remain skeptical.

GON:  
Yeah, let's not be John Cleese. Allow me to explain. 

In a skit from John Cleese’s training videos called _Why do people work?_[^cleese] he portrays a typical sixties factory worker in the UK. While explaining how boring and repetitive his job at the factory is (all he does all day is pull on a lever) he complains about job satisfaction (none) and salary, which is the only good thing about the job. The money is his only reward, because he can at least use that to have a good time. The end of the video shows us that that good time means pulling on a lever at a slot machine. It goes to show in a very clever way that he claims not to like the repetition but he actually loves it and doesn't really want to do anything else.

![Are you living the life you've always wanted to live?](img/one-armed.png)

Leaves me with the question, what do we want to do? We might be clueless, actually. But let's make sure that we never let these machines take over what we really want to do, whatever that may be. Let's not forget, we're all here to enjoy life, make something good out of it.

REN:  
Agreed! Let's not be John Cleese!

OPT:  
Ditto! Bye bye John Cleese!
