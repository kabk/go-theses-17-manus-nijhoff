#CONCLUSION

In my research I've been all over the place. Now I want to distill some of the things I've learned.

It was necessary to include Silicon Valley as it's layed the base for a lot of things that will come. Just as TV shows and movies nowadays still use tropes from early Hollywood inventions, tech will keep using lots of the ideas coming from Silicon Valley in the future. 

Designing for the internet, online life. I think it's hard to say. We should do what we think is good. 

I am not cynical about technological advancement. Reading and learning about the powers behind it has however made me much more skeptical about the impact tech has. 

It's been a very USA-centric research, so I hope to learn more in the coming times about other cultures, such as the Asian background in technology.

On the one side, Silicon Valley is big corporate companies with enormous global influence. On the other hand it's the startups, the more messy world with sometimes insane investments and sometimes great innovation. Its culture influences entrepreneurs all around the world. I will keep watching the developments of the states of labour that come from it to learn from the experiences of others. I will always inspect defaults, because implicit defaults have a more profound influence than explicit optional features. 





> Why insist that the changes are over? Artists who begin with the proposition that the phenomena of their world are boring and banal, who begin with an exasperated sigh, are going to produce art that is boring and banal, art that produces exasperated sighs.  
> â€” Brian Droitcour [^droitcour]


One thing I've really learned while writing these sometimes incoherent pieces of text, is that I am not the only one with my obsession, my obsession with the internet. It's a globally shared obsession for good reason. The technological advancements are big, the consequences for human beings have been far-reaching. Sometimes harmful, oftentimes fixing problems. 




People are often totally self-responsible for what they do and have to design their life with technology. Some pitfalls come from technology that designers, but also just people should be aware of. 



- Oversimplification. Very handy in programming, not so handy IRL (In Real Life). Trust your audience, they have an imagination. They don't read barcodes, they read stories, ideas, jokes. 
- Distraction for the sake of distraction. 
- Reverence of technology is bad, designers come up with ways of demystifying tech! 
- Use tech as your slaves. I think designers are pretty good at this already. Pass that attitude on to users. They know there's more to life than likes. 
- Design as immunisation: Actively prevent quasi-innovations from happening.
- Be subversive to big systems but learn from them. It can be useful to see Google as your enemy from time to time but it doesn't make sense to blame them for all the problems in the world.
- Approach new services with distrust and keep checking what free services get from you. Some things are not made in your best interest. 
- Ennui principle: Build up and release.
- Use the dÃ©rive as an inspiration. Go with the flows of the stream and find all that good stuff.
- Always keep messing with things, no matter how big or boring.

I'm going to sign off for a bit now. All this internet talk has left me stupid, unreflective, overloaded. But I'll sharpen my typing nails and be back in a day or two. Or less.

#AFTERWORD

I just want to give this little bit of Benjamin Bratton for you:

> At a societal level, the bottom line is that if we invest in things that make us feel good but which don't work, don't invest in things which don't make us feel good, but which may solve problems, then our fate is that in the long run it will just get harder and harder to feel good about not solving problems.

DESIGN IS JUST A TOOL. IN THE WRONG HANDS IT WILL DO WRONG THINGS. THE SILICON VALLEY OF DISRUPTION DOES NOT HAVE THE ANSWER, BUT LOOKING AT THEM MAY GIVE SOME IDEAS. 

We should be asking what the internet is distracting us from, not how the internet is distracting us. 

For fluff sake, it's going to be a very difficult time for the arts. Right-winged politics took the USA, where Mr. Trump took a country by surprise. The biggest party in the Netherlands is racist and will take a lion's share in next February's election. Geert Wilders made public threats to the Morrocan community, he literally said he would CLEAN SHIP without specifiying what. This is harmful. Politicians need to specify what they mean, empty words lead to confusion. Is there really no alternative for this politics of anger?

The internet's distracted us for a nice run. It was fun on there, but we should also really spend some time with people around us. See what they're up to. See what you can do together to have fun, or to help. 

A diversion into military equipment (what the internet originally was). Disguised by sleek design, tempting with simple interfaces, catchy flashy sexy sensual all of that but what if that doesn't matter anymore and you're not feeling good in the streets? Everybody has a plan until they get hit in the face. By Big data, refugee crises, politicians with terrible haircuts. And all the while we just want to learn to understand our peers better. Whatttttt has it come 2.
