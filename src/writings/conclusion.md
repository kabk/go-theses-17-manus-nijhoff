# EPILOGUE

Dear reader,

Thanks for reading. Now I know I am not the only one with my obsession, my obsession with the internet. It's an obsession and for good reason. The technological advancements are big, the consequences for human beings have been far-reaching. Sometimes harmful, sometimes helpful. 

I want to give some general comments I've picked up while writing.

I think there are a lot of people who feel stuck with the internet. At least I felt stuck with it. And after that think art and design should always be something that makes that feeling go away, may that be on- or offline. 

It's a divisive technology, but it's best used for sharing.

I am not cynical about technological advancement. I still think there's a lot of good to be done with it. Reading and learning about the powers behind it has however made me a lot less gullible about the impact of technology. Like in the case of NSA spying, or when it is used to make insane profits over people's hard work.

We'll keep coming up with ways of demystifying technology. Design as immunisation. 

And we'll keep being subversive towards big systems and we'll learn from them. It can be useful to see Google as the enemy from time to time but it doesn't make sense to blame them for all the problems in the world.

Avoid oversimplification. It's very handy in programming to make things as simple as possible, but it's just not so interesting in real life. Trust your audience, they have an imagination. They don't read barcodes, they read stories, ideas, and jokes. 

Approach new services with skepsis and keep checking in on the ones you use. Some things are not made in your best interest.

Publish stuff! Where you feel fit.

Where to look for the future? First of all to the institutes of this world, because their culture makes society. It's been a very USA-centric research, so I also hope to learn more in the coming times about other industries, such as the Asian influence in technology. 

Secondly I'm curious about this coming year. Right-winged politics took the USA, where Trump took a country by surprise. The biggest party in the Netherlands is racist and will take a lion's share in next February's election. Public threats were made to the Morrocan community, the biggest islamophobe of NL literally said he would CLEAN SHIP without specifiying what. This is harmful. These kind of empty words make nothing better. What's the alternative for this politics of anger? 

The internet's distracted me for a nice run. It was fun on there, but we should also really spend some time with people around us. See what they're up to. See what you can do together to have fun, or to help. 

> At a societal level, the bottom line is that if we invest in things that make us feel good but which don't work, don't invest in things which don't make us feel good, but which may solve problems, then our fate is that in the long run it will just get harder and harder to feel good about not solving problems.
