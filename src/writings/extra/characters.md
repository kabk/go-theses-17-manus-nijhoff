##Characters

The thesis deserves an approach that is human, non-factual and sensual as much as it needs a factual basis.  

I will adopt three recurring ways of speaking to present my research. They are three characters. The characters are based on interviews and talks I've had with people as well as articles and documentaries and my own personal experience.

The characters are design critics, rather than designers. But every person does have a sense of self-design.

I do this mainly because in personal experience there is always the first-person perspective, the world through a shaped filter. In these characters I reconstruct ways of thinking from evidence gathered in the process of reading. 

Secondly, many of the things I've learned from the internet is not by reading pages in a book, but reading from online sources. The way we read online is different from the book in the way that it usually involves more people. A Wikipedia article is a crowd-based piece of information, groups of people make articles appear in your feed and comment sections show instant discussion between readers.

##CAST

Common goal: in the conclusion they will explain how they work together towards the common goal, which is developing an AI?

##GONZO (GON)

- **The gonzo**: The gonzo uses the network with full enthousiasm but without joy or need for personal gains. They know the system is rotten and they don't feel responsible for it. The gonzo spends time binge-browsing around the internet and reports with a sometimes sarcastic, sometimes humourous point of view. They have a vast knowledge of subcultures, memes, visual archives.   
_This is the immersed mode of browsing_
- Romantic, serendipitous, hedonist

##OPTIMO (OPT)
- **The optimizer**: Using the network for the optimizer is not a problem. The optimizer has efficiently matched his or her habits to the system, making them a leading force and role model of the networked life. With a sharp eye for business opportunities, the optimizer uses hashtags to gain followers, sells articles via facebook groups, and has sold his/her startup companies for profit. A savvy manager.  
_This is the utilitarian mode of browsing_ 
- Pragmatic, managing, goal-driven
- Operating Systems: Mac, iOS phone. Up to date. Nothing else
- Connects to thesis from: Amsterdam (AMS)  

##THE RENEGADE (REN)
- **The renegade**: Despises the network in its current state. Knows a lot about the history of the internet. A desillusioned person with a hawk eye's overview of the internet. The renegade is looking for the next network to explore. The current one is broken.  
_This is the disinterested mode of browsing._
- Idealist, eco-conscious, rigorous   
- Operating Systems: LINUX, MAC / WINDOWS, Android. All-knower but with strict preference for open-source.  
- Connects to thesis from: Berlin (BL)
