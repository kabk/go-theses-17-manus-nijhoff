# INTRODUCTION

At the core of this research is an obsession. It is an obsession. My obsession with the internet. And your obsession with it. That is the first reason for me to write this essay. I am completely obsessed by the possibilities of the medium but at the same time skeptical about how it is used. 

Only a short 22 years after its launch to a public audience,[^wiki] the internet has made its way firmly into our lives. The transition from an offline to an online world is pretty complete right now. At least here in Europe, at least here in the Netherlands, where in 2014, the internet penetration rate was 94.9%.[^rate] 

Users and providers interests clash constantly. What is best for Google might not be best for you, and vice versa. But we _are_ interdependent. We have to keep living life with technology. At this point it has become essential to our lives. It's not to be ignored. Rather, we should be taking a much closer look into some of the technologies that drive our societies.

A lot of development of the internet originates from the United States. The land of the American Dream. I want to take a peek into their world. Without ever having been there, I think I know something about this crazy place through all of my scattered internet knowledge. I want to test that. 

I want to question the upwards spiral of technological advancement. I look specifically at the influence the tech industry has in this story. With the tech industry I mean the industry that develops goods, software, services and platforms on the internet. Sometimes free for us to use. The industry that has Silicon Valley as its Jerusalem. This industry is key to designers because it fundamentally shapes the tools, the people and the culture that we work with.

I am not an ultimate expert of the internet. But I am also going to try to look at these problems from engineering points of view, playing a kind of technological etymology.

Some people are ultimate experts of the internet. They know about obscure things, things like packet switching and network sniffing. Regular users aren't ultimate experts. You, me. But although we might not know how everything works behind the screens, we're the ones that know what we want from it. We can identify failure or success without looking at any review, rating, or performance measure. But: users are being kept in the dark about how things work. We are being pushed into a spectator role. I think that should change. We should become a bit more like the ultimate experts. 

Maybe this is where the designer comes in. The designer is both a user of technology as well as a shaper of content and interface on digital platforms. 

I tried to do a general take on the internet. I failed miserably. But in the process, I've found out a lot of things about the daily technologies that we use.

I've adopted three ways of speaking to present my research in the form of three characters. The characters represent opinions and attitutes from interviews and talks fused with articles, documentaries and my own personal experience.

The way we read online is different from the book in the way that it usually involves more people. A Wikipedia article is a crowd-based piece of information, groups of people make articles appear in your feed and comment sections show instant discussion between readers. 

## Characters

The characters go by the screen names of Gonzo, Optimo and the Renegade.

Gonzo is in his mid twenties. Based in The Hague (NL), he dropped out of design school and a Computer Science college degree to work on his art. Child of a mother and father that are supportive of his life choices. He has a job working at an electronics store. Via a message board for app developers he met Optimo.

Optimo is a man, 32 years old. He lives and works in Amsterdam as a Human Resources manager for the public transport company of the city. In his spare time he enjoys going for a run or visiting galleries in the city. And most of all he likes to spend time on little programming projects. On the message board, Optimo and Gonzo also meet The Renegade. 

The Renegade is the hardest one to reach. No one really knows who she is but she has been a moderator of the forum for more than 20 years now. It's known that The Renegade has worked as an engineer in the tech industry of the USA and that she's based in Berlin, with her partner Alex.

This team never met up IRL yet. For a couple of years, they have been discussing developments around Silicon Valley and technological innovation via a message board. They're looking in from the outside and are looking for ideas to pick up and make into a common project. But they always disagree. What follows are some of their discussions.
