#Filter Troubles 

##OPTIMIZING COMMUNITIES

REN:
A community is usually something that forms over time. Friendships grow, relationships are built up and broken down in smooth motions. There can be a kind of natural organization. I'm not sure if it can be called optimization and if it can be optimized. In online communities there is a whole deal of building, guiding and optimizing, so let's discuss the makeable community.

##The Front Page of the Internet or the Social Utility That Connects You With Other People Around You

GON:  
I'm a big fan of Reddit. It's a social news platform spanning about every topic you can imagine. Sports, politics, help groups, the full monty. It's called social news for its ranking system. Users upvote or downvote news that they find good or interesting and earn karma points for participating in the community. 

OPT:  
I never got around to using Reddit. The interface just isn't comfortable for me.

GON:  
Oh, you're really missing out! It takes some patience to get into this thing, but once you're in there you'll wonder how you ever did without it! 

REN:  
I'll explain some things about it. It's got a fantastic history. If you say reddit, you have to say Aaron Swartz. The Internet's own boy. At a young age he was already involved in developing things like RSS and the Markdown programming language, which is in wide use today. He was an activist for freedom of speech online. And he co-founded Reddit. 

GON:  
On Reddit, the system in place relies on a kind of direct democracy, but it doesn't exclude all downvoted posts. There is a category for controversial posts which features content that have a small difference between up- and downvotes. Subreddits are there for specific topics. 

REN:  
Yes, Reddit is a big site. It's content comes from users, the moderators are users and it seems to work. Unlike social networks that want your information to feed you back your own preferences into algorithms, the community learns from each other. 

One element that makes it work I think is choice of content. On reddit, you decide what subreddits you subscribe to. Subreddits work around topics, not people. That's the first thing you do when you use the site. You subscribe to smaller communities on this huge message board system. The content comes first, and the people on the site make the discussion. 

That leads to another aspect which makes reddit so succesful. In the process of delivering content to you, the advertisements stay out of your feed. The platform is essentially non-commercial. 

He really was an idealist. Someone who cared for the societal impact of his own choices. He went down in history with a tragic ending, but this showed also his over the top idealism. While studying at MIT, Swartz had access to the JSTOR database. Sharing that is what eventually led to his tragic death. 

Aaron Swartz called himself a sociologist. In one of his blog posts[^blog] that institutes shape culture. He say criticizing culture is too superficial. It makes more sense to look at the institutions behind them. 

OPT:
How does reddit compare to Facebook?

RENL  
Discussion. Reddit trusts people! Which is a key element in open discussion, new ideas, critique, etc. I think design can learn from this basic element of trust. In many media that are prepared by graphic designers, the audience gets messages dumbed down so much that it almost misses its initial point. Trust your audience, ppl.

In the end, reddit does a much better job in connecting people, and building an online community in the sense that the people using it aren't left feeling trapped or tricked by their own circles, which happens more often in Facebook's community. Ironically, all of our close friends are connected via Facebook while we meet new people on reddit. 

If we call Reddit the open community, let's call facebook the filter bubble. Where reddit's content is filtered by people, Facebook uses algorithms. Reddit can be weird not because reddit is weird but becaue people are weird. Life: it is whhat you make it.

OPT:  
How does that work?

REN:  
Facebook works with an algorithm called edgerank. 

##Fluff Buster's Purity

OPT:  
I'm using this tool recently for Facebook that's called F.B. Purity. Not really liking it, it looks very Web 2.0. Facebook's interface is always changing so the tool can be pretty buggy.

REN:  
Yeah, but it does what you want. You can't always judge a tool just on the looks or user-friendliness. The people making that stiuff usually do it on their own time and without any payment from anyone! This dude is focussing on the essentials to keep it working. If you think about it, it's kind of amazing. He's like a little David against Facebook Goliath. It's fucking DIY!

OPT:  
No, I think I'll give up on it. It takes me too much time to manually add the list items. I want someone or something to do that for me. It shouldn't be that hard, right?

REN:  
I'm not too sure about that. I don't think this guy has a big team or a lot of resources to develop it as professionally as a Silicon Valley startup would. But in that is a lot of value, this person is an idealist. It's underground and independent. 

GON:   
I love this solution, it's clumsy and perfect. Hail the clumsy solutions, the hacks and stooges. 'Cause this is still showing the cracks in the pavement, right? Still showing that people aren't satisfied with what's in front of them.

##Hail the clumsy solutions

OPT:  
I've switched to Self Control.

Every person experiences the world through their own filter.

If looking through the filters of Facebook, these get echoed back to you.

The dérive, psychogeography of Guy Debord, studying the city.

Dériving on the internet is more boring if you do it as yourself.

Because. Does it wrong: Facebook (easy target but hey)

Finding obscure subcultures is great because there is a big-ass community.
