##OPTIMIZING COMMUNITIES

A community is usually something that forms over time. Friendships grow, relationships are built up and broken down in smooth motions. There can be a kind of natural organization. I'm not sure if it can be called optimization. In online communities there is a whole deal of building, guiding and optimizing.

##The Front Page of the Internet or the Social Utility That Connects You With Other People Around You

Reddit is a social news platform spanning about every topic you can imagine. Sports, politics, help groups, the full monty. It's called social news for its ranking system. Users upvote or downvote news that they find good or interesting and earn karma points for participating in the community. 

One of the founders of this website was Aaron Swartz, dubbed The Internet's wonder boy. At a young age he was already involved in developing things like RSS and the Markdown programming language, which is in wide use today. He was an activist for freedom of speech online. And he co-founded Reddit. 

On Reddit, the system in place relies on a kind of direct democracy, but it doesn't exclude all downvoted posts. There is a category for controversial posts which features content that have a small difference between up- and downvotes. Subreddits are there for specific topics. 

Yes, Reddit is a big site. It's content comes from users, the moderators are users and it seems to work. Unlike social networks that want your information to feed you back your own preferences into algorithms, the community learns from each other. 

One element I think is choice of content. On reddit, you decide what subreddits you subscribe to. Subreddits work around topics, not people. That's the first thing you do when you use the site. You subscribe to smaller communities on this huge message board system. The content comes first, and the people on the site make the discussion. 

That leads to another aspect which makes reddit so succesful. In the process of delivering content to you, the advertisements stay out of your feed. The platform is essentially non-commercial. 

He really was an idealist. Someone who cared for the societal impact of his own choices. He went down in history with a tragic ending, but this showed also his over the top idealism. While studying at MIT, Swartz had access 

Aaron Swartz called himself a sociologist. In one of his blog posts[^blog] that institutes shape culture. Criticizing culture was too superficial, it makes more sense to look at the institutions behind them. 

Let's look at how reddit compares to facebook, for instance.

Discussion. Reddit trusts people! Which is a key element in open discussion, new ideas, critique, etc. I think design can learn from this basic element of trust. In many media that are prepared by graphic designers, the audience gets messages dumbed down so much that it almost misses its initial point. Trust your audience, ppl.

In the end, reddit does a much better job in connecting people, and building an online community in the sense that the people using it aren't left feeling trapped or tricked by their own circles, which happens more often in Facebook's community. Ironically, all of our close friends are connected via Facebook while we meet new people on reddit. 

If we call Reddit the open community, let's call facebook the filter bubble. Where reddit's content is filtered by people, Facebook uses algorithms.

##EdgeRank

Facebook works with an algorithm called edgerank. No editors on reddit. Reddit can be weird not because reddit is weird but becaue people are weird. Life: it is whhat you make it.

Every person experiences the world through their own filter.

If looking through the filters of Facebook, these get echoed back to you.

Dériving on the internet is more boring if you do it as yourself.

Because. Does it wrong: Facebook (easy target but hey)

Finding obscure subcultures is great because there is a big-ass community.
