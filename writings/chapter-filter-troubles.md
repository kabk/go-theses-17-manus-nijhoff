# Filter Troubles 

## OPTIMIZING COMMUNITIES

REN:  
A community is usually something that forms over time. Friendships grow, relationships are built up and broken down in smooth motions. There can be a kind of natural organization. In online communities there is a whole deal of building, guiding and optimizing, so let's discuss the makeable online community.

## The Front Page of the Internet or the Social Utility That Connects You With Other People Around You

GON:  
I'm a big fan of Reddit. It's a social news platform spanning about every topic you can imagine. Sports, politics, help groups, the full monty. It's called social news for its ranking system. Users upvote or downvote news that they find good or interesting and earn karma points for participating in the community. 

OPT:  
I never got around to using Reddit. The interface just isn't comfortable for me.

GON:  
It takes some patience to get into it, but once you're in there you'll wonder how you ever did without it! 

REN:  
Reddit has an interesting history. When you say Reddit, you have to say Aaron Swartz. At a very young age he was already involved in developing the web feed format RSS and the Markdown publishing format. He was an activist for freedom of speech online and he co-founded Reddit. 

He also was an activist. Someone who cared about the societal impact of the internet. While studying at MIT, Swartz had access to the JSTOR database. Swartz, who also constituted the Creative Commons License together with Lawrence Lessig, believed this knowledge should be available for everyone. He went into the server room of the institute and copied the data on a hard drive.

The FBI knew Swartz from another case where he published documents of PACER[^pacer]. When they suspected him of wanting to puclish JSTOR documents they installed a camera in the server room and caught him on tape. He then got overcharged for his crime: 35 years of jail time awaited him. He hung himself, leaving no note.  

OPT:  
How is this relevant?

REN:  
Well, it shows that he was an extremely intelligent and commited guy, that really had some ideas about public information. 

Aaron Swartz called himself a sociologist. In one of his blog posts[^blog] he writes that institutes shape culture. He says criticizing culture is too superficial. Instead you have to look at the institutes that shape culture. So let's look at Reddit, and maybe compare it to FB.

GON:  
On Reddit, the system in place relies on a kind of direct democracy. It works with a voting system that works two ways. You can vote up and down. But it doesn't exclude all downvoted posts. There is a category for controversial posts which features content that have a small difference between up- and downvotes. Subreddits are there for specific topics. 

REN:  
It's content comes from users. The moderators are users and it seems to work. Unlike social networks that want your information to feed you back your own preferences into algorithms, the community learns from each other. 

One element that makes it work I think is choice of content. On reddit, you decide what subreddits you subscribe to. Subreddits work around topics, not people. That's the first thing you do when you use the site. You subscribe to smaller communities on this huge message board system. The content comes first, and the people on the site make the discussion. 

That leads to another aspect which makes reddit so succesful. In the process of delivering content to you, the advertisements stay out of your feed. The platform is essentially non-commercial. 

GON:  
I think the discussion part of it. Reddit trusts people! Which is a key element in open discussion, new ideas, critique, etc. I think design can learn from this basic element of trust. In many media that are prepared by graphic designers, the audience gets messages dumbed down so much that it almost misses its initial point. Trust your audience, ppl.

In the end, reddit does a much better job in connecting people, and building an online community in the sense that the people using it aren't left feeling trapped or tricked by their own circles, which happens more often in Facebook's community. Ironically, all of our close friends are connected via Facebook while we meet new people on reddit. 

Where reddit's content is filtered by people, Facebook uses algorithms. Reddit can be weird not because reddit is weird but becaue people are weird. Facebook has a lot of censorship and a new kind of content-picking. You only see stuff that is relevant to you.

## EdgeRank

OPT:  
So how does Facebook filter their content?

REN:  
Facebook works with an algorithm called EdgeRank.[^edge] Every story, post, or interaction on Facebook is called an Edge. Every Edge gets a value, based on three things. Affinity score, weight and time. Nobody knows exactly how, but based on those values the items come into your newsfeed. 

It has very serious consequences, especially because this means that if your edge doesn't score well, no one will see it.

So if you're looking through the filters of Facebook, these get echoed back to you. Guy Debord, an artist from the Situationist movement, went on trips to get lost. While he got lost, he would study the city. He called this psychogeography.  

Dériving on Facebook would be much less interesting than in the city. If you do it as yourself. You will just get stuck in loops of familiar people, familiar stories and links, it's really limiting.

_Other People Also Bought_[^other] is a really interesting artwork by Jonas Lund, it starts from one article on eBay and then moves to the next automatically recommende item. This would be much more targeted today than it would be in 2013 when they made this.

The reinforcing effect is what I think is kind of scary. In a Science article in 2008[^carr-2], Evans noted that automated information-filtering tools, such as search engines, tend to serve as amplifiers of popularity, quickly establishing and then continually reinforcing a consensus about what information is important and what isn’t.

## Fluff Buster's Purity

OPT:  
I'm using this tool recently for Facebook that's called F.B. Purity. You can block keywords from your newsfeed. Not really liking it, it looks very Web 2.0. Facebook's interface is always changing so the tool can be pretty buggy.

REN:  
Yeah, but it does what you want. You can't always judge a tool just on the looks or user-friendliness. The people making that stiuff usually do it on their own time and without any payment from anyone! This dude is focussing on the essentials to keep it working. If you think about it, it's kind of amazing. He's like a little David against Facebook Goliath. It's fucking DIY!

OPT:  
No, I think I'll give up on it. It takes me too much time to manually add the list items. I want someone or something to do that for me. It shouldn't be that hard, right?

REN:  
I'm not too sure about that. I don't think this guy has a big team or a lot of resources to develop it as professionally as a Silicon Valley startup would. But in that is a lot of value, this person is an idealist. It's underground and independent. 

GON:   
I love this solution, it's clumsy and perfect. Hail the clumsy solutions, the hacks and stooges. 'Cause this is still showing the cracks in the pavement, right? Still showing that people notice that they aren't in control, and this is one way of taking it back, even when it is just a bit.
