# The Art of Extremity

##(OPTIMIZATION IN THE ARTS)

- Art School means poor people with expensive taste.

Beautifully enough, the expensive taste bit of the quote is a little bit less true on the internet, where you can use the services available for free. Remixing is free, even sophisticated software is available for free, movies, sometimes high-reolution images all free. 

- Post-Internet Art - movement that optimizes its art for the internet. The physical work does not matter anymore. Just the representation.

- And the catalog Art Post-internet.

- Fake It till you make it, a direct result of American culture?
