##(OPTIMIZING SELF)

What's up guys, it's Optimo, and today we're going to talk about self-optimization!

Soylent

REN: 
Have any of you tried Soylent?

GON:
Soylent, the powder that replaces food! Not for me, I'll stick to real food, thanks.

OPT:
Yeah, I'm using it. Alright, bear with me.

Soylent is a â€œregular foodâ€™ replacement. It comes in a powder to be mixed up with water and contains all of the nutrients a human body needs. If you are in a rush, or you are uninspired to cook, this stuff helps. It's also a more sustainable solution for the environment. The process of production takes calories from a very common algae culture, which can be grown efficiently. 

REN:
My first reaction was that if everyone would eat this food, the entire planet could be very well off. It's an efficient solution to food, but only when lots of people take it.

GON:
What is the secret of Soylent Green? ðŸ˜ˆ [^people]

OPT:
Good one. The Soylent Green movie is actually based on a sci-fi novel from 1966 called _Make Room! Make Room!_[^room]. That book introduced a version of NYC in which overpopulation caused people to resort to Soylent (soy and lentil) and water on ration. The Soylent Green film took it one step further.. 
All jokes aside though, I know it plays into the sentiment of science fiction. But science is also what makes this stuff possible. Rob Reinhardt, the man behind Soylent, has a vision of a world after food. He wants to make it independent from agriculture, eventually. When agriculture doesn't scale with human needs, which he says it will, this could be the thing to replace it. So it's not just convenient, it's also a step towards a solution for future food problems. According to a report called How To Feed The World 2050, the world will have 9.1 billion citizens that need food. We're going to need to improve things and optimize things and a lot of that comes from science and technology.

His goal is to make it independent of agriculture.

Tendency to say design is better than nature, or synthetic is better than nature.

Take this to take care of your needs and then eat well on the weekends.

Total food replacements were on the market for years, bigger innovation might be the marketing.
