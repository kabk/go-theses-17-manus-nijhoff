#CONCLUSION

I don't have the answer.

To make stuff better is not bad. But:

I do think design should be aware of the traps of optimization of tech allows. If there is one thing I've learned is that human beings and our systems have different agenda's. There are some things in life that don't need optimization. Optimization isn't the same as attention. It gets very awkward when you start believing technology has the answer to all of your problems. But it's tempting. And a lot of times technologies _can_ help us.

Some pitfalls come from technology that design should be aware of.

- Oversimplification. Very handy in programming, not so handy IRL. Trust your audience, they have an imagination. They don't read barcodes, they read stories, ideas, jokes. 
- Distraction for the sake of distraction. 
- Reverence of technology. 

Oh, I'm so strict now, all of a sudden. 

But, yeah. Gonz, do you have anything to add? 

- Use tech as your slaves? I think designers are pretty good at this already. Pass that attitude on to users. They know there's more to life than likes. 
- Design as immunisation: Actively prevent certain innovations from happening.
- Be subversive to big systems but learn from them. It can be useful to see Google as your enemy from time to time but it doesn't make sense to blame them for all the problems in the world.

Yeah, optimo, you probably have the last word:

Thanks. I would say, be subversive towards big systems 

If you get stuck in a 'Monkey Trap' situation

- Ennui principle: Build up and release.
- Use the d√©rive as an inspiration. Go with the flows of the stream and find all that good stuff.

And always keep messing with things!
