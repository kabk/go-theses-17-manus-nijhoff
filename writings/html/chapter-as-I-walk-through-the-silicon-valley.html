<p>Idea of GAFAM.</p>
<p>The sentence describing Silicon Valley, the series: “In the high-tech gold rush of modern Silicon Valley, the people most qualified to succeed are the least capable of handling success”.</p>

Ha, sentimental today? Internet is dead, man. Bruce Sterling, writer of cyberpunk novels and design critic, argued in 2014 that it doesn't make sense to still talk about the internet<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. That we should instead talk about GAFAM – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft. This makes perfect sense. These companies have been shaping the internet in very real ways. If you are not using one of GAFAM's services, your neighbor or government is.</p>

Tell me oh gr8 R3n3g4d3, why did you bring this hot potato into the conversation tonight?</p>
<p>REN:<br />
Well, I was overthinking this quote. These are the people setting our defaults, right? Let's call it defaultism. People love consistency. We say we want change, but we also want everything to remain the same. Defaultism describes the happiness and wilingness of people to use an unchanged, working design.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the internet, people were customizing everything, wanting to touch every part with their own style. Hell, the whole idea of stylesheets – code to stylize web pages – was to have a <em>personal</em> stylesheet, which you could use on every page on the internet. Instead, pages would offer their own stylesheets. Now after that stylistic power has been moved from the individual user to the provider, new standards came to be which we are now happily accepting, <em>because they work</em>.</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk about the people setting the defaults, because they go way beyond the looks of a website. In fact, that's only the first thing you see it happening.</p>
<ul>
<li>visionaries / dictators. Zuck, The Iron man</li>
</ul>
<p>Silicon Valley</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the defaults in user agreements</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the places where defaultism is very harmful is in the User Agreement. That's essentially a legal document you should read before acccepting to cooperate. Nobody reads it of course, and so in the light of using a free service, you accept. But to what? You don't know. And that kind of default can be really harmful.</p>
<p>I may generalize a bit when I say Silicon Valley cooperates with the United States authorities, but yes. Google will give the United States military access to basically any data stored on their servers. NSA has a finger in the porridge.</p>
<p>And the only thing you can do is weep and regret. But realize that these documents are made to be uncomfortable to read. This here is a kind of extortion. It's an unfair game, so don't be sorry you've lost it.</p>

<li>Commercial Science: smart!</li>
</ul>
<p>GON: <em>Silicon</em>. A material that puts your personal ideals behind the steering wheel. A material that supports bigger boobs and smaller computer chips. The computer chip manufacterer has since long left Silicon Valley, but what stayed behind is still shaping the world.</p>
<p>I see Silicon Valley as the Hollywood of technology. Comfortably situated on the West Coast of the United States, it is a birthplace that exports amazing things. Technology instead of movies. And while movies were already of a huge influence on our culture, the technology wave is much more customized and designed for the individual. All of your personal desires and needs will be satisfied by your smartphone. At least that is the promise.</p>
<p>The American Dream, a hard climate with lots of competition, little or no government support, I'm not really sure what to attribute the American individualism to, but I think it's very blatant in some things that are developed there. Every single thing that makes it to the top is fucking dripping of Sell-Me-Fat. It's crazy.</p>
<p>I like to play a game sometimes. Name anything and we'll see if there's a startup in Silicon Valley working on something that connects to that.</p>

Pants</p>
<p>GON: Alright, let's see. Athos. Raised $35 million<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in November 2015 and are working on smart pants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Athos. Building a better human machine.” Scott Anderson, Director of Athletic Training at Stanford University</p>
</blockquote>
<p>REN:<br />
People as machines, I really cannot grasp how this has become such a popular thing to say. Isn't that the only thing we're not?</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Nobody likes a smarty pants, but pants are getting smart. A company from the United States called Athos is now selling wearables that use small EEG sensors to measure muscle activity and give you real-time information about your sports routine. It uses science to convince and athletes to model for their commercials.</p>

<p>Benjamin Bratton gave a very insightful talk at TEDx San Diego[^benjamin]. He used the stage to critique the format TED uses. He argues that TED is not really critical towards technology. Instead, the institution books speakers that tell incredible stories of how technology changes the world while these visions do not always come true.</p>
<p>Bratton makes a case for design as immunisation. Design, he says, should not only focus on innovation but also on making ourselves immune for the things we don't need.</p>
<p>I don't know if we need the new wearables. But I do get the feeling that there is some overlap with the problem Bratton addresses towards TED and things like wearables and Smart objects. TED has faith in technology. But, Bratton says, not enough commitment to technology. It is a fetishization of the optimal condition, making any performance sub par worthless while this might not be the case.</p>
<p>Calling objects 'smart' in itself is a strange practice, I think. Weren't watches already very well made devices before the smart watch came along? How smart is it to buy a smart phone? Isn't it kind of stupid to keep on calling a little machine that can only do things it is programmed to do - smart?</p>
<p>REN:<br />
And another American thing: faith. Believe in technology!!!</p>

<p>Angel investors are the shiny demons that come to help your company be good in the world. A Fetish of optimization can also lead to forced entrepreneurialism. Silvio Lorusso, an Italian in the Netherlands, made a striking portrait where he made a supercut of two Silicon Valley founders that</p>
