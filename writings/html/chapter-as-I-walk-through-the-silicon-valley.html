Have you seen the new HBO series Silicon Valley? I can totally recommend it. If you're interested in the birthplace of GAFAM and the insane climate there, it's worth watching.</p>

What's GAFAM?</p>
<p>REN:<br />
Bruce Sterling, writer of cyberpunk novels and design critic, argued in 2014 that it doesn't make sense to still talk about the internet<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. That we should instead talk about GAFAM – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft. This makes perfect sense. These companies have been shaping the internet in very real ways. If you are not using one of GAFAM's services, your neighbor or government is.</p>
<p>I was overthinking this quote. These are the people setting our defaults, right? Let's call it defaultism. People love consistency. We say we want change, but we also want everything to remain the same. Defaultism describes the happiness and wilingness of people to use an unchanged, working design without question.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the internet, people were customizing everything, wanting to touch every part with their own style. Hell, the whole idea of stylesheets – code to stylize web pages – was to have a <em>personal</em> stylesheet, which you could use on every page on the internet. Instead, pages would offer their own stylesheets. Now after that stylistic power has been moved from the individual user to the provider, new standards came to be which we are now happily accepting, <em>because they work</em>. Defaultism has become common practice.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Now you mention it, it's actually pretty strange that we're all so well-synced. You would think there would be as much diversity as there are people.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
Well, let's talk more about the people setting the defaults, because they go way beyond just the looks of a website. In fact, that's only the first place you see it happening.</p>
<p>One of the places where defaultism is very harmful is in the User Agreement. That's essentially a legal document you should read before acccepting to cooperate. Nobody reads it of course, and so in the light of using a free service, you accept. But to what? You don't know. And that kind of default can be really harmful.</p>
<p>I may generalize a bit when I say Silicon Valley cooperates with the United States authorities. But GAFAM does. They will give the United States military access to basically any data stored on their servers. The United States likes this centralized power because it's easy access for them.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>And the only thing you can do is weep and regret. But realize that these documents are made to be uncomfortable to read. This here is a kind of extortion. It's an unfair game, so <em>don't be sorry you've lost it.</em></p>
<p>The computer chip manufacterers are what made the Valley what it is. That industry has since long left Silicon Valley, but what stayed behind is still shaping the world. Right now, GAFAM are all based in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Silicon. The material that supports bigger boobs and smaller computer chips.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
I see Silicon Valley as the Hollywood of technology. Comfortably situated on the West Coast of the United States, it is a birthplace that exports amazing things. Technology where Hollywood exported movies. And while movies were already of a huge influence on our culture, the technology wave is much more customized and designed for the individual. All of your personal desires and needs will be satisfied by your smartphone. At least that is the promise.</p>
<p>The promise, the American Dream! A climate with lots of competition, little or no government support, I'm not really sure what to attribute the American individualism to, but I think it's very obvious in the culture of Silicon Valley. There's this focus on personal development. That anyone can be anything. That ideal is amazing and attractive.</p>
<p>And it sells technology very well, because they are good at shaping technology in ways that are very interesting to human beings.</p>
<p>OPT:<br />
So, besides GAFAM, what else is happening in the Silicon Valley?</p>
<p>REN:<br />
There is a big startup culture. A startup is essentialy nothing more than a beginning company. In Silicon Valley there is a strong belief that startups can disrupt the market. Disruption is a marketing term where your product changes the market completely instead of just competing with the existing products or services on that market.</p>
<p>Lots of startups in the technology sector compete for a place in the market. And because technology is big business, there is a lot of money to be won. Or lost. The pace of business is high.</p>
<p>These startups are often funded with money from Venture capitalists or Angel Investors. VC's are institutions, Angel Investors are individuals who put their money in the company and act as a kind of business mentor.</p>
<p>Silvio Lorusso, an Italian artist, designer, and researcher based in Rotterdam, made a striking portrait where he made a supercut of two Silicon Valley founders that both commited suicide.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The basis of the problem of these two men is what he calls the entreprecariat. The entreprecariat is a fusion of entrepreneurialism and the precariat. It's a broad term to describe struggling entrepreneurs. I think his take on Silicon Valley's startup culture painfully shows a darker side of startup culture.</p>
<p>GON:<br />
Phew, that's heavy. Let's do something fun now. I like to play a game sometimes. Name anything and see if there's a startup in Silicon Valley working on something that connects to that.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
Pants</p>
<p>GON: Alright, let's see. Athos. Raised $35 million<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> in November 2015 and are working on smart pants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Athos. Building a better human machine.”<br />
Scott Anderson, Director of Athletic Training at Stanford University</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A company from the United States called Athos is now selling wearables (wearable technology) that use small EEG sensors to measure muscle activity and give you real-time information about your sports routine. It uses science to convince and athletes to model for their commercials.</p>

<p>Benjamin Bratton is professor of visual arts and director of the center for design and geopolitics at the University of California, San Diego.</p>
<p>In 2013 he gave a very insightful talk at TEDx San Diego<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. TED is a non-profit organization that originated in California. They organize conferences where speakers talk about their personal involvement in Technology, Entertainment and Design (T-E-D) and more. Usually a TED speaker will give an insight into a technology they are developing, a project they initiated with a focus how that helps society. The format is key to their existence. Videos have to be under 18 minutes long so they can be uploaded and watched by a big audience online.</p>
<p>Benjamin Bratton used the stage to critique the format TED uses. He argued that TED is not really critical towards technology. Instead, the institution books speakers that tell incredible stories of how technology changes the world while these visions do not always come true. He calls this ‘toying with technoradicalism.’ Bratton says TED has <em>faith in</em> technology but not enough <em>commitment to</em> technology. The institute puts too much emphasis on the optimal condition. It lacks sharp critique.</p>
<p>Instead, Bratton makes a case for design as immunisation. Design, he says, should not only focus on innovation but also on making ourselves immune for the things we don't need.</p>
<p>I don't know if we need the new pants from Athos. But the problem Bratton addresses towards TED and things like wearables and the Internet of Things do make me take a double take. What's the use of knowing exactly what each muscle does? The makers as well as users of technology put heaps of faith in the products, especially when they appear smart.</p>
<p>Calling objects 'smart' in itself is a strange practice, I think. Weren't watches already very well made devices before the smart watch came along? How smart is it to buy a smart phone? Isn't it kind of stupid to keep on calling a little machine that can only do things it is programmed to do - smart?</p>
