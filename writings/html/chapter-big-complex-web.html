So Silicon Valley is where the ideals of optimization have taken flight. Now, one of the places where optimization makes a huge difference is the back-end of big services and platforms. For instance Netflix or Amazon. The cloud is servers spinning on a rack, interconnected with cables. Wireless is only a half-truth. There are strings attached.</p>
<p>Services designed for our daily lives, things like Uber, Deliveroo, Maps, have all been designed with the objective of ‘scalability’ in mind. Scalability means that these systems will get better when they grow. These systems optimize by growth. So as they exist, we can now ask: <em>is bigger better?</em></p>
<h2 id="the-chaos-monkey">The Chaos Monkey</h2>
<p>GON:<br />
True story: Netflix has been releasing monkeys inside their server centers that wreak havoc and shut down parts of their systems. It started with one monkey, but soon an entire legion of apes was formed, each one trained to break another part of the servers.</p>
<p>REN:<br />
In 2012 Netflix released an open source version of this Simian Army. Now everyone can use Netflix' monkeys inside of their server rooms.</p>
<p>At Netflix server centers they have this approach called the Chaos Monkey. This basically shuts down random parts of their server infrastructure with the only reason to see if the system stays up. The system <em>needs</em> these little destructions to survive, just like organisms are dependent on smaller creatures or bacteria to survive.</p>

<p>This has some heavy implications. What if you disagree with a system? If even kicking over that system means that it can learn and regenerate? It's a scary thought. What can you do to be subversive?</p>
<p>Well, like X said, there are still errors to exploit. And I think you should always be on the lookout for those exploits. They usually happen at the fringes of tech or society. In the decentralized network called Ethereum, there was a big crash recently. Let me explain it to you here.</p>

I love watching this video of the sorting robots in Amazon's warehouses.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Amazon services that use the chaos sorting approach. By making the</p>
<p>Massive selection. 21 million types of items into one system. Robots eliminate the walk that amazon pickers used to do. Everything is delivered to the picker. Fastest cycle times are under 15 minutes. It's all about more product in the same footprint. It doesn't need walk space so the warehouse is more densely populated with goods. Scalable as hell.</p>
<p>Pick, scan, pack. We try to simplify their life and hide the technology. All Kiva Pick workers are happy pick workers. <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>At Amazon, the warehouses no longer store items categorically. Rather, the objects are placed on the shelves according to what's fastest. And in turn, when the item needs to be retrieved, the robots picking up the items find their fastest way. Optimized time in the back allows Amazon to run a huge online shopping experience while remaining fast access.</p>
<p>So what all of these examples suggest is that the bigger a system gets, the more chaos it needs to survive. Order has its limits when it goes too far.</p>
