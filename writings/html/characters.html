<h2 id="characters-1">Characters</h2>
<p>The thesis deserves an approach that is human, non-factual and sensual as much as it needs a factual basis.</p>
<p>I will adopt three recurring ways of speaking to present my research. They are three characters. The characters are based on interviews and talks I've had with people as well as articles and documentaries and my own personal experience.</p>
<p>The characters are design critics, rather than designers. But every person does have a sense of self-design.</p>
<p>I do this mainly because in personal experience there is always the first-person perspective, the world through a shaped filter. In these characters I reconstruct ways of thinking from evidence gathered in the process of reading.</p>
<p>Secondly, many of the things I've learned from the internet is not by reading pages in a book, but reading from online sources. The way we read online is different from the book in the way that it usually involves more people. A Wikipedia article is a crowd-based piece of information, groups of people make articles appear in your feed and comment sections show instant discussion between readers.</p>
