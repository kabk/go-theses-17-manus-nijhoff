<h1 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>I don't have the answer.</p>
<p>To make stuff better is not bad. But:</p>
<p>I do think design should be aware of the traps of optimization of tech allows. If there is one thing I've learned is that human beings and our systems have different agenda's. There are some things in life that don't need optimization. Optimization isn't the same as attention. It gets very awkward when you start believing technology has the answer to all of your problems. But it's tempting. And a lot of times technologies <em>can</em> help us.</p>

<p>Some pitfalls come from technology that design should be aware of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oversimplification. Very handy in programming, not so handy IRL. Trust your audience, they have an imagination. They don't read barcodes, they read stories, ideas, jokes.</li>
<li>Distraction for the sake of distraction.</li>
<li>Reverence of technology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, I'm so strict now, all of a sudden.</p>
<p>But, yeah. Gonz, do you have anything to add?</p>
<ul>
<li>Use tech as your slaves? I think designers are pretty good at this already. Pass that attitude on to users. They know there's more to life than likes.</li>
<li>Design as immunisation: Actively prevent certain innovations from happening.</li>
<li>Be subversive to big systems but learn from them. It can be useful to see Google as your enemy from time to time but it doesn't make sense to blame them for all the problems in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, optimo, you probably have the last word:</p>
<p>Thanks. I would say, be subversive towards big systems</p>
<p>If you get stuck in a 'Monkey Trap' situation</p>
<ul>
<li>Ennui principle: Build up and release.</li>
<li>Use the dérive as an inspiration. Go with the flows of the stream and find all that good stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>And always keep messing with things!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-of-the-conclusion">CONCLUSION OF THE CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>I just want to give this little bit of Benjamin Bratton for you:</p>
<p>At a societal level, the bottom line is that if we invest in things that make us feel good but which don't work, don't invest in things which don't make us feel good, but which may solve problems, then our fate is that in the long run it will just get harder and harder to feel good about not solving problems.</p>
<p>😪</p>
<p>DESIGN IS JUST A TOOL. IN THE WRONG HANDS IT WILL DO WRONG THINGS. THE SILICON VALLEY OF DEATH DOESNOT HAVE THE ANSWER, BUT LOOKING AT THEM MAY GIVE SOME IDEAS.</p>
<p>We should be asking what the internet is distracting us from, not how the internet is distracting us.</p>
<p>For fuck sake, it's going to be a very difficult time for the arts. Right-winged politics took the USA, where Mr. Trump took a country by surprise. The biggest party in the Netherlands is racist and will take a lion's share in next February's election. Geert Wilders made public threats to the Morrocan community, he literally said he would CLEAN SHIP without specifiying what. This is harmful. Politicians need to specify what they mean, empty words lead to confusion.Have we really no alternative for this politics of anger?</p>
<p>The internet's distracted us for a nice run. It was fun on there, but we should also really spend some time with people around us. See what they're up to. See what you can do together to have fun, or to help, maybe that's what this whole thesis was about.</p>
<p>A diversion into military equipment, disguised by sleek design, tempting with simple interfaces, catchy flashy sexuy sensual all of that but what if that doesn't matter anymore and you're not feeling good in the streets anymore. Everybody has a plan until they get hit in the face. By Big data, refugee crises, right wing politics flexing their muscles. And all the while we just want to learn to understand our peers better. Whatttttt has it come 2.</p>
<p>I'm going to sign off for a bit now, the internet is broken. But I'll be back in a day or two, because I can't really go without this thing.</p>
