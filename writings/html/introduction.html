What's up guys</p>

Hello fellows</p>
<p>OPT:<br />
Hi!</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The obsession that is at the core of this research is one you might recognize. It is an obsession. My obsession with the internet. That is the first reason for me to write this essay. I am completely obsessed by the possibilities of the medium but at the same time skeptical about how it is used.</p>
<p>Twenty-and-a-bit years after its public launch,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> a lot of the technologies made possible by the internet have made their way firmly into our lives. The transition from an offline to an online world is pretty complete right now, at least here in Europe.</p>
<p>A big aspect of technology in general is optimization. The act of making the best or most effective use of a resource. If you are an engineer at Google you want to optimize search to keep making profit, to in turn make smarter Artificial Intelligence, a better server infrastructure, better self-driving cars, et cetera. If you are a user of Google, you want to search the best song of the day while you're taking the fastest route to work. To save time. To save money. To be efficient.</p>
<p>Users and providers interests clash constantly. What is best for Google might not be best for you, and vice versa. But we <em>are</em> interdependent. We have to keep living life with technology. At this point it has become essential to our lives. It's not to be ignored. Rather, we should be taking a much closer look into some of the technologies that drive our societies.</p>
<p>A lot of development of the internet originates from the United States. The land of the American Dream. I wanna take a peek into their world, without ever having been there, I think I know something about this crazy place.</p>
<p>I want to question the optimization fetish that comes from technology. It influences daily lives of us all, whether it's first hand or second hand. And it's happening on both sides of the spectrum.</p>
<p>I want to look specifically at the influence the tech industry has in this story. With the tech industry I mean the industry that develops goods, software, services and platforms on the internet. Often free for us to use. The industry that has Silicon Valley as its Jerusalem (or Alexandria). This industry is key to designers because it fundamentally shapes tools that we work with. And more than that. No software, no platform, no service, no device is without ideology. This is where we have to be critical.</p>
<p>I am not an expert of the internet. But I am also going to try to look at these problems from engineering points of view, playing a kind of technological etymology.</p>
<p>I think programmers are also not the ultimate experts of the internet. The ultimate experts are the users. People. You, me. We might not know how everything works behind the screens, but we're the ones that know what we want from it. We can identify failure or success without looking at any review, rating, or performance measure. There is a problem with influence. Users can't directly fix things that bother them. Users are being kept in the dark about how things work. Users are being pushed into user-dom.</p>
<p>Maybe this is where the designer comes in. The designer is both a user of technology as well as a shaper of content and interface on digital platforms.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I pose the question:</p>
<p>How does design relate to optimization in the tech industry?</p>
<h1 id="characters">Characters</h1>
<p>I will adopt three recurring ways of speaking to present my research. They are three characters. The characters represent opinions and attitutes from interviews and talks fused with articles, documentaries and my own personal experience.</p>
<p>I do this mainly because in personal experience there is always the first-person perspective, the world through a filter, shaped by experience. It is that kind of view of the problems posed here that I want to expand.</p>
<p>Secondly, many of the things I've learned from the internet is not by reading pages in a book, but reading from online sources. The way we read online is different from the book in the way that it usually involves more people. A Wikipedia article is a crowd-based piece of information, groups of people make articles appear in your feed and comment sections show instant discussion between readers.</p>
<p>And I still believe discussion is the most interesting way of learning. This narrative structure is an attempt to show different sides of the medal.</p>
<p>The characters go by the screen names of Gonzo, Optimo and the Renegade.</p>
<p>Gonzo is in his mid twenties. Based in The Hague (NL), he dropped out of design school and a Computer Science college degree to work on his art. Child of a mother and father that are supportive of his life choices. He has a job working at an electronics store. Via a message board for app developers he met Optimo.<br />
Optimo is a man, 32 years old. He lives and works in Amsterdam as a Human Resources manager for the public transport company of the city. In his spare time he enjoys going for a run or visiting galleries in the city. And most of all he likes to spend time on little programming projects. On the message board, Optimo and Gonzo also meet The Renegade.<br />
She (?) is the hardest one to reach. No one really knows who (s)he is but she/he has been a moderator of the forum for more than 20 years now. It's known that The Renegade has worked as an engineer in the tech industry of the USA and that he (?) resides in Berlin, with h(er/is) partner Alex.</p>
<p>This team never met up IRL yet. For a couple of years, they have been discussing developments around Silicon Valley and technological innovation. They're looking in from the outside and are looking for ideas to pick up and make into a common project. But they always disagree. What follows are some of their discussions.</p>
