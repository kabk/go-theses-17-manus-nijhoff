#CONTROL AND QUESTION

##INTRODUCTION

The paradox that is at the beginning of this research is one you might recognize. It's an obsession. My own obsession with technology. That is the first reason for me to write this essay. I am completely obsessed by the possibilities of the medium and at the same time skeptical about how it is used. Internet: The placeless, time-consuming medium that connects all of the world.

People are always unsatisfied with the internet. It can always be better, faster, more honest, less invasive.

It is up to us to change the things we dislike. To put them under close inspection and see where things could be different. Maybe not better, but at least different.

The great thing about the internet is that when you think of an idea, there probably already are people doing it somewhere. Innovation and creativity have a place in the world.

I am skeptical about the promises that are connected to the internet. The internet, initially a military network, has been completely open for commercial purposes - and with that, a more public user base - since 1995. Free services aren't without cables attached. The cloud has a firm basis on earth.

Everybody also wants to use the internet in the best way. What is best is of course totally dependent on who you are and what you want. If you are Google, you want to use it to make profit, to make smarter Artificial Intelligence, or better server infrastructure. If you are a user of Google, you want to search the best song of the day while you're taking the fastest way to work.

These interests of course, may clash. What is best for Google might not be best for you, and vice versa.

But we _are_ interdependent. We have to keep living life with technology. This paradox is where I'm triggered.

I want to question the optimization fetish that comes from technology. It influences daily lives of us all, wither first hand or second hand. 

Programmers are not the ultimate experts of the internet. The ultimate experts are the users. The ones not knowing how, but the ones that know what they want from it. The problem is of course that they cannot advise, because they don't know anything about the tech. This is where the designer comes in. The one that is both a user of technology as well as someone who has an understanding of what goes on behind the scenes. 

The effect technology can have on mankind is like the effect of religion. Smile to your neighbour. Now send a smiling emoji to your neighbour. People appreciate technological communications highly. We get intense satisfaction from using our machines that are so advanced and complex. But this effect can have paralyzing consequences. It can lead to not-questioning, auto-acceptance, auto correction. And that is bad. Designers should work on exposing the paralyzing hypnosis of technology. 

God is dead, and so is technology. But that does not keep them from having a hell of an impact on our lives.
