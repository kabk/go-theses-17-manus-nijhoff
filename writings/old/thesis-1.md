##(INTRODUCTION)

WELCOME TO THE AFTER-NOUGHTIES

>“A mind as boundless as the internet”
>The Evening Standard, blurb on the back of Jaron Lanier's book “Who Owns The Future?”

A moment of your time please, I am here to talk to you about the Internet's bounds.

>Talking about the future is a polite way of saying what's wrong about the present
>Benjamin Bratton

Bruce Sterling, writer of cyberpunk novels and design critic, argued in 2014 that it doesn't make sense to still talk about the internet. That we should instead talk about GAFAM – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft. This makes perfect sense. These companies are now shaping the internet in very real ways. If you are not using one of GAFAM's services, your neighbor or government is.  

_Silicon_. A material that puts your personal ideals behind the steering wheel. A material that supports bigger boobs and smaller computer chips. The Silicon has since long left Silicon Valley, but what stayed behind is still shaping the world.

So these are the giants that design and implement our services.

Benjamin Bratton has another power structure in mind. He uses the metaphore of the ‘Stack’, which is a vertical division of separate layers that are interconnected. The Stack's layers from bottom up are Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, User. Starting from Earth, ending at one person. You, me. 

With big power comes big responsibility. GAFAM have a lot of opportunity to design how we think, work, and play. While we – small-time designers educated in art schools – were busy designing interfaces, their big-time design teams backed by GAFAM's infrastructure and knowledge – were learning to implement social engineering knowledge into their interfaces. 

Does that mean follow or die? Should designers pick one or the other side? Or is there a more hybrid, custom approach to design and what it can do. The shift of power from central government to the cloud is probably paralyzing and at the same time a catalyst. Are we over- or underestimating possibilities and power of the designer? 

People love consistency. We say we want change, but we also want everything to remain the same. In the case of interface design the answer is _defaultism_. Defaultism is the term used to describe the happiness and wilingness of people to use an unchanged, working design. 

In the beginning of the internet, people were customizing everything, wanting to touch every part with their own style. Hell, the whole idea of stylesheets – code to stylize websites – was to have a _personal_ stylesheet, which you could use on every page on the internet. Instead, pages would offer their own stylesheets. Now after that stylistic power has been moved from the individual user to the provider, new standards came to be which we are now happily accepting, _because they work_.

What is the balance between _comfort and surrender_? Between _default and custom_?

What is the balance between _self-control and ignorance_?
	Agency online, what a person can and cannot control.

What are the consequences of a dysfunctioning internet? Which paradoxes do we face with the internet as an infrastructure and how do we deal with them?

##Trust

Problem: How is trust established online?
Answer: Blockchain is a possibility

(The Renegade)

“I fantasize sometimes about the end of electricity. The machine stopping at the apex of its own performance. That people would find themselves isolated, but suddenly together. With all the fascinating and horrifying character treats that were normally hidden under the gleaming surface. Reinventing the wheels, social structures, culture and trade while in total chaos and emergency. It would be an ugly world, but would it be more ugly than the one we're in right now?”

Users and people are one and the same nowadays. In Dutch a a user (gebruiker) could mean a user of drugs, which is a popular use of the word. Now users are people. Or are people users?

Besides the silliness of this little observation, the word user is sometimes interchanged with consumer. This switch shows the same tendency, to see a human being in a system primarily as a consumer, whether that is consuming food or news. And this is a bit strange to me. Do we really just consume our news?

We want to immerse in the network, but why? Is it a fleeing from the daily reality that doesn't excite and satisfy us? I mean, did it ever? This is one of the main reasons why I think people get addicted to gaming, internet, social media, whatever. There's not enough joy. Maybe not enough trust.

Trustless. That is the idea of the Blockchain. 

What is trust? 

>“Trust in value exchange occurs when we do not know fully whether what we are receiving is what we expect. When we buy a car, don’t want to be sold a ringer which the seller knows is faulty. When I get advice in business, I want it to be based on facts, not wild opinions.”

Predictability

How is the Blockchain trustless?

Blockchain boasts with the feature of the network that is ‘trustless’. What does trustless really mean? That we can give in control. 

According to my Mac's dictionary, to consume meand either to eat, drink, digest, buy, use up (a resource), completely destroy (especially of a fire), or to absorb all of the attention and energy of someone. It's a very negative word which suggests all people are depleting earth's resources.

It comes from Latin where consumere came together from _con-_ (altogether) and _sumere_ (to take up).



___

##Control and Suffering  

Problem: Social media takes more time than it should from people
Answer: There are a lot of quasi solutions (Selfcontrol, Distractagone) but it seems also that some people are more susceptible to dependence. 
It is tricky to call it an 'addiction' because it still is a social network. Time Well Spent - > Going towards design that does 'well' to people.

(The gonzo)

Have you seen the Distractagone? 
No I haven't. Can you explain?
The Distractagone is a cube-shaped vault with a timer on it. It basically allows you to keep your phone locked inside for an X period of time. And during that time you are undistracted! It sounds like a great idea, Gonzo sarcastically put forward. But isn't this a forced solution? It's like hiding candy from children. That's never stopped them from taking the candy if they really wanted it.

I have been listening to a Podcast of two net artists: Rafaël Rozendaal and Jeremy Bailey. It is nice to hear them quarrel about topics related to the internet, artificial intelligence, the idea of an archive, et cetera. Both are very interested in new developments in technology but they have very different approaches towards them. Rozendaal is a techno-pessimist, always waiting for new technology to crystallize before using it. Bailey is a techno-optimist. He adopts new techniques quickly. 

What are the pros and cons of defaultism in interfaces?


### Distraction Addiction / Destination Procrastination

Problem: Do people like the distraction though? Will they accept Time Well Spent?
Answer: ...

If there is one thing that keeps coming back in the influence of the internet on personal life, it must be distraction. The infinite scroll, keeping us captive, autoplay that's on default on and _You Might Also Like_ this mug with a cat-face.

_And their eyes glazed over_

Joelle Renstrom wrote a killer article. In the article the question if internet use is an addiction comes up. Her experience is remarkable because she teaches at Boston University, a very prestigious college. The trouble and work (and money) required to get in is apparently not enough to motivate students to leave their technological habits on the side in class. 

Get your body snatched!

Her position in all of this is critical towards technology. 

>“multitasking instead of failing to focus.”

>“Technology demands a significant amount of time and attention and has conditioned them to not question it. It takes up more and more of their bandwidth, and the net effect is lobotomising.”


And in this term I think there is a shift between the old and new generation. The inpatient millenial stands together with the outpatient Babyboomer on the sphere of the internet. The babyboomer spells doom while the younger generation is like “chill, grandpa.” And what a nice situation to observe. Never before has the internet been used by people of such different ages. All ages use the network. The youngest don't know a life without it, the generations between might still have a vague idea of life before the internet and the older generations may be struggling to cope with digital technologies. 

History is there to be ashamed of. Or at least, that's a common joke. When asked to see his browser history, someone might say, “haha, better not!” because it might expose some private sexual preferences they don't want to share.

I think this pattern is more than a little joke, though. A review of colonial influences, looking back at the mistakes of industry and realizing the long-lasting influences of religion serve as lessons for the present. 

If we always remember only selectively we get misinformed. Erasing uncomfortable parts of history is not something we should be doing. Let's not forget that remembering is an important part of learning. 

Fugue – (psychiatry) A state or period of loss of awareness of one's identity, often coupled with flight from one's usual environment, associated with certain forms of hysteria and epilepsy.

In his piece “Double In Fugue” Robert Rapoport describes the Remembrancer of London[^remembrancer], a man that used to play a truly important economical part in the daily life of London’s _City_, the financial district. The remembrancer today serves a purely ceremonial function. 

The parable shows how the old systems of finance clash with the new law of the market in the ceremonial presence of _The Remembrancer_.  

>Paul Double has to embody a paradox.   

>Double has begun to see, with the help of the quants, that in this emergent space there is no ‘corporate memory’.

But, like the Dutch king, a ceremonial function is still a statement. 

The Office was set up to act as the corporate memory and this is reflected today in his role of advising the City Corporation on constitutional issues

-> The remembrancer of London and the financial district. Distruct, destruct, distract.

Computers as Poison, the attitudes and stances towards networks back in the days compared to now

Many examples of the “dark side” of computers and internet use can be found. In January 1985, some years even before the WWW, followers of Steward Brands's legacy of the Whole Earth Catalog, published an edition of their magazine _Whole Earth Review_ titled _Computers as Poison_. Subtitled _All panaceas become poison_

(piece about it's -sometimes uncanny- equal to today's situation and talk about if stuff came true or not)

Atemporality -> how we see history now.

##Fleeting Time


Going on the internet to lose a sense of time? 

The gambling story

As an addict of video poker says: “(...) The more I gamble, the less I got about my chances. Wiser, but also weaker, less able to stop.”

Is the internet an addiction? Is it a hypnosis? Is it a new medium with which we deal so much we just don't know how to handle it?

Design as an addiction counselor. How are designs trying to shape this behaviour?

Self-control (app) -> Charlie Stigler. Start from addictive quality of the internet to a person that just knows how to deal with it because he/she is not sensitive to the addictive part of it.

A more sadistic and much less frequently used remedy is the Pavlov Poke. It basically shocks you when you stay on for a too long time. 

This direct translation of an anti-barking collar is sadistic and works upon conditioning. The challenge is not how to condition the individual but how to influence the crowd without being cruel and using techniques from politics like perception management.

Related to running, the _runner's high_, professional athletes professionaly suffering to expand their personal limits.

###Filter Troubles

Perception management, customized to the person.

I took matters into own hands. Or at least made some attempt at that. Bought a €10,- phone at Mediamarkt. Almost as cheap as a pack of cigarettes. I posted my phone number on the social media I frequent with a short message. But the weird thing is, that I have no idea who will read my message. The algorithms will decide.  

This demonstrates simply how overly social media have become. It's discriminated the friends that don't like me — with a slight margin, finding out exactly how the algorithms work is a tough challenge[reference](reference)— and decided who gets to see my goodbye.

_Down For Everyone Or Just Me_ is a very reassuring page to be on. As the name implies, you can use the site to check if a website is down for you alone or for everyone.

There should be a _News for everyone or just me_ site, where you can check your sources.

##Optimization

> “Athos. Building a better human machine.”
> Scott Anderson, Director of Athletic Training at Stanford University

Nobody likes a smarty pants, but pants are getting smart. A company from the United States called Athos is now selling wearables that use small EEG sensors to measure muscle activity and give you real-time information about your sports routine. It uses science to convince and athletes to model for their commercials.

![Athos pants](img/athos-pants.png)

Benjamin Bratton gave a very insightful talk at TEDx San Diego[^benjamin].
He used the stage to critique the format TED uses. He argues that TED is not really critical towards technology. Instead, the institution books speakers that tell incredible stories of how technology changes the world while these visions do not always come true.

Bratton makes a case for design as immunisation. Design, he says, should not only focus on innovation but also on making ourselves immune for the things we don't need. 

I don't know if we need the new wearables. But I do get the feeling that there is some overlap with the problem Bratton addresses towards TED and things like wearables and Smart objects. TED has faith in technology. But, Bratton says, not enough commitment to technology. It is a fetishization of the optimal condition, making any performance sub par worthless while this might not be the case.

Calling objects 'smart' in itself is a strange practice, I think. Weren't watches already very well made devices before the smart watch came along? Smart is not for sale.

##Maakbaarheid en Mythe, Community and the Melinnial

There are many movements where communities form without borders of nations but by interest. 

People are 'syncing' like never before.

The sentence describing Silicon Valley, the series: “In the high-tech gold rush of modern Silicon Valley, the people most qualified to succeed are the least capable of handling success”.

There is the monomyth, where one person tries to take on the world. 

Now, there is the crowd-myth. And this myth is good because it supports a vision of a society. A mode of living _together_ but still having personal influence.

Myths are not essentially false, they are just an ideal or theatrified version of reality. The use of myths is very real because it simplifies a thing that is too complex to grasp. But we should be aware _that_ we are already using myths, and that's what is the bad side of technological trust. 

George Steiner. Marxism was a myth, psychoanalysis was a myth, what is the myth of design? 

The unicorn myth, 

Leonardo da Vinci (Homo universalis)

And now the replacing myth should be that of the power of the network. Pioneers of this myth could be (maybe) Metahaven? Maybe? Larry Page?

##Boring Internet, Hot Internet

A near infinite source of ideas and information. (I'm talking about the World Wide Web again). What does that mean? That means _a lot_ of opinions, _a lot_ of facts and _a shitload_ of other information. The internet brings all of that to you. 

Nicholas Carr reasons that human beings aren't at all made for this kind of information. According to him, multitasking is a skill that used to be necessary in order to survive. If you weren't constantly shifting focus, you wouldn't notice a predator or another danger and you might be dead before you knew it.  

He argues that people are now suffering from this ‘predetermined’ survival instinct. According to Carr, we are in the process of losing the ability for deep reflective thought because we adapt constantly to new and faster information technologies. 

And he might be right. As I write, next to my communications and next to my entertainment system, I have the possibility to switch around the entire time. I also try to multitask and I also often fail, because my mind is just limited. I can't focus on many things at once.  

But: I wonder if this new urgent way of treating information is something we should worry about. It's, after all, a reality already. In social media it is a matter of in or out, and when you're out, you lose some things. 

Invitations, jokes, maybe even friendships. But I would say that the internet offers also another ‘deep, reflective thought.’ Maybe the ways of the book are just over and people think in more ephemeral, associative ways. Ways that might have their own qualities. 

A new understanding of the world.

The disability to learn from humans in combination with the computer and depending on an extra digital layer does leave me with a sense of loss. I wouldn't be as disappointed if the internet we would use would have something really amazing to offer, _if the internet would be more like a real human being_. With flaws and abnormalities that would _not_ be coded away, debugged, and that would not simply be left behind for a newer version, because it couldn't be. An internet as a developing persona that would reflect some of the struggles that we humans face. Instead of connecting, we would be relating to the web.

But the personalizing of the internet has been tried and resulted in an array of options, which might be called interesting.

“fucking emojis”, “quasi-personal interface design (which usually is fake chat screens)”, “avatars, reducing a person to a medal with a nice reflection of themself.”, “”

Actually it would be better to have a boring internet with no options and freedom. This view is what I'd like to call the nazi-internetists.

Then, there is the modern equivalent of brutalist architecture, gathered in the brutalist website movement

And then there is the touchable, playable internet, where every button is happy and all interactions feel like a fresh breeze and all of that, just for you!

> “Life is pain, highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something.”  
> – Dread Pirate Robberts (Farmboy)

Dread Pirate Roberts (a.k.a. Ross Ulbricht) is the creator of Silk Road and a successful internet pioneer. He claimed the name Dread Pirate Roberts from a family film called _The Princess Bride_. The movie is a fairy tale of good versus evil. The Dread Pirate Roberts is an infamous bandit, scouring the seas for loot. No one man knows this pirate's true identity. And it is never the same. DPR is a changing identity. When one pirate dies or goes to land, the next takes over. The one is not one, but many.

(LITTLE BIO FOR R.U.)

For Ross Ulbricht, the idea of this changing identity must have been a great ideal, but pirates also get caught. Ulbricht is now facing life sentences in prison for making drug trade and more dark business possible online.

His fans are trying to break him free by crowdfunding cash for his defense. [^ulbricht] 

What were his ideals? How did they clash with the ideals of society / government?

#Conclusion  

The internet has changed agency. Acting in enormous systems makes it possible to act very big very fast but can also render an individual powerless. 

Technology has given us back some virtues: we might get paid for taking time to sleep, or a basic income could be coming to your neighborhood. All of these ideas come and spread and take over people's ideas. 
And not, at the same time. Putting technology at the center of all of our problems is ignorant and distracting. Instead, we should be paying attention to people around us. Not paying people in Pakistan to increase our following. What kind of followers do you need? 

We don't have all the pieces of the puzzle. But these pieces I put together. Maybe it was in a forced way, and probably I've misplaced some of the parts. But how much I like talking in metaphores, I want to tell you, thanks for reading. I hope you can use this.

And diegetic!

Diegesis (/ˌdaɪəˈdʒiːsɪs/; from the Greek διήγησις from διηγεῖσθαι, "to narrate") is a style of fiction storytelling that presents an interior view of a world in which:

details about the world itself and the experiences of its characters are revealed explicitly through narrative
the story is told or recounted, as opposed to shown or enacted.[1]
In diegesis the narrator tells the story. The narrator presents the actions (and sometimes thoughts) of the characters to the readers or audience.

Design should be hypocritical and apologetic in its stance towards technology. Meaning it should explain technology but approach it ambiguously, knowing that it is not knowing. Design should function. And its function is to debunk myths about so-called certainties. The machine, the network, the smart watches, they are not right, they are not wrong. The value judgement lies more and more with the user, which design still serves. But, design also serves itself and in this respect it could mirror more the technological dilemmas and problems of the infrastructure. In order to ‘fit’ better with the underlying personal, technological, glocal motives, let design mimic the Simian Army. Knock yourself out, be wrong, and recuperate. What it shouldn't do is to leave filter bubbles unpopped, to let fake news articles reign. The person is just one. The network is many.

_If design lives on, this is how it should work to deal with corporate powers, third, fourth, fifth parties’ interests and, last but not least, the self._
