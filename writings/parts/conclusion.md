I don't have the answer.

To make stuff better is not bad. But:

I do think design should be aware of the traps of optimization of tech allows. If there is one thing I've learned is that human beings and our systems have different agenda's. There are just some things in life that don't need optimization. It gets very awkward when you start believing technology has the answer to all of your problems. But it's tempting. And a lot of times technologies _can_ help us.

Some pitfalls come from technology that design should be aware of.
- Oversimplification. Very handy in programming, not so handy IRL. Trust your audience, they have an imagination. They don't read barcodes, they read stories, ideas, jokes. 
- Distraction for the sake of distraction. 
- Reverence of technology. 

Oh, I'm so strict now, all of a sudden. 

But, yeah. Gonz, do you have anything to add? 
- Use tech as your slaves? I think designers are pretty good at this already. Pass that attitude on to users. They know there's more to life than likes. 
- Promote sustainable lifestyles?
- Be subversive to big systems but learn from them. It can be useful to see Google as your enemy from time to time but it doesn't make sense to blame them for all the problems in the world. They did do some amazing things.

Yeah, optimo, you probably have the last word:

Thanks. I would say, be subversive towards big systems 

If you get stuck in a 'Monkey Trap' situation
- Ennui principle: Build up and release.

And always keep messing with things!
