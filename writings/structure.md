#CONTROL AND QUESTION / THINK OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE

##The impact of digital design on personal experience

___

Theme: 

## How does internet use affect people in their personal sphere?

Central Research Question: 

## How does design reflect current ideals of success?

Embedded in the research will be the question or stance that humans are more important than their networks/infrastructures. It should explore the sense of loss of humanity or conectedness to each other, go through different attitudes we have towards the internet as a solution to problems or a medium for change.

##Sub Questions

- What are current ideals of success?  
- How does web design influence people subliminally?  
- How is the medium internet supporting success and failure?  
- In who's best interest are ubiquitous networks?  

___

#Structure

##Characters

It is key to my research to include personal experience in the essay/thesis. Alongside the presented research I will adopt three recurring ways of speaking that are based on three characters. The characters are based on interviews and talks I've had with people as well as articles and documentaries and personal experience.

Mainly because there is no way I can be entirely factual about the topic _the internet_. The thesis deserves an approach that is human, non-factual and sensual, as much as it needs a factual basis.
Secondly, many of the things I've learned from the internet is not by reading pages in a book, but reading _web pages_. And often reading them while I was in one of the “modes of browsing” they stand for. 
Lastly it gives me a way to highlight ways people experience the internet from an insider's perspective. 

- **The gonzo**: The gonzo uses the network with full enthousiasm but without joy or need for personal gains. They know the system is rotten and they don't feel responsible for it. The gonzo spends time binging around the internet and reports with a sometimes sarcastic, sometimes humourous point of view.  
	- _This is the immersed mode of browsing_   
- **The optimal**: Using the network is not a problem. The optimal has efficiently matched his or her habits to the system, making them a leading force and role model of the networked life.  
	- _This is the utilitarian mode of browsing_  
- **The renegade**: Despises the network in its current state. Knows a lot about the history of the internet. A desillusioned person with a hawk's eye overview of the internet. The renegade is looking for the next network to explore. The current one is broken.  
	- _This is the disinterested mode of browsing._


##PITFALLS, BACK OF HEAD

- I want to avoid coming to a premature conclusion or opinion by writing “personally”.  
- Maybe there is something better to say about the internet than a lesson per se. I wanna avoid my writing to become patronizing and/or demonizing, mainly because that seems to be countereffective.........
- I am always open for responses at [manusnijhoff@gmail.com](mailto:manusnijhoff@gmail.com) for objections, comments and insights.

##Introduction

##Wild, _enfant sauvage_
_Which arts and design practices are exposing the relation human beings have to the internet? How do these arts relate to the balance of human discipline? Which radicals are to be found? A shocking chapter. Leonardo da Vinci working for Google. The author is an angry Trump supporter that didn’t believe he would actually be elected. The gonzo of digital space that reports back with suggestions and proposals The renegade escaping the internet, looking for the next network to exploit. This character will reappear in parts of the thesis to show its views and shake things up. This is the burst that precedes the fall._

##Control and Ego, Suffering  
_What are “filter bubbles” good for? How do social media pull us in? Why do we keep coming back to it? What is the role of the ego in these networks? Can people control their impulses? Are we being dominated by computers and machines? What efforts are people making to take control of their own impulses? How do people try to escape the internet?_

##Strategies from History  
_With a focus on the history of addiction / conditioning research and computing / tech / systems research: Can we learn from history? Which ways does history repeat itself? How can we learn from that to improve?_

##Fleeting Time  
_Who’s time are you spending? Are you planning flexibly towards yourself? Philosophising about ways to live, play, and work._

##Optimization X Disaster  
_Personal optimization is an ideal in health and in work. Do the ends justify the means? Are we adapting willingly to systems that will drive us into extinction? Formula life, the food / nutrition debate, fueled by sponsored brands._
 
##Malleability, Makeability and Myth  
_Should mankind always improve itself? After looking at the dynamic of self control is it really useful? Why do people seem to be interested in personal achievement so much? Critiquing the thesis that we are living in a simulation. Using that example to drag people out of their personal sphere and wake them up to a world where people live, work, love together (utopian view) or to show them a world where people do not live, work, love together (dystopian view)_

##Boring Internet  
_Why are we annoyed by the internet? In who’s interest are you using the WWW? How does web design reflect the current ideals of success and career? How would the internet have changed our society and how did it play out?_

##Conclusion  
_If design lives on, this is how it should work to deal with corporate powers, third, fourth, fifth parties’ interests and, last but not least, the self._
