#CONTROL AND QUESTION / THINK OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE

##The impact of digital design on personal influence

___

Theme: 

##How does internet use affect people in their personal sphere?

Central Research Question:  

##Where does the internet fail and what opportunities does it offer designers?

I take the stance that humans are more important than their networks/infrastructures. I question the ways in which we use our infrastructures and how designers can relate to the conditions of contemporary techno society. 

##Sub Questions

- How is the relation of influence between the designer of and the user of online platforms and services? 
	There are different possible relations, of which I can identify 
		- The powerless designer. Only executing the work that others give him/her from top down. 
		- The societally conscious one, that designs ‘well’ and bases the designs on human needs.
		- The designer as artist, that uses techniques like design fictions and speculates on what could be.

			-> How is the design actually used as opposed to its intended use?

- Which paradoxes are key to being a designer today?
		- Ethics (What spans the scale between _white hat_ and _black hat_ designer?)

##PITFALLS, BACK OF HEAD

- NB that the character pointers are not mentioned explicitly more than once. No need for typecasting. Suggestion is key.
- I want to avoid coming to a premature conclusion or opinion by writing “personally”.  
- Maybe there is something better to say about the internet than a lesson per se. I wanna avoid my writing to become patronizing and/or demonizing, mainly because that seems to be countereffective...
- I am always open for responses at [manusnijhoff@gmail.com](mailto:manusnijhoff@gmail.com) for objections, comments and insights.

##Introduction

##Wild, _enfant sauvage_
_Which arts and design practices are exposing the relation human beings have to the internet? How do these arts relate to the balance of human discipline? Which radicals are to be found? A shocking chapter. Leonardo da Vinci working for Google. The author is an angry Trump supporter that didn’t believe he would actually be elected. The gonzo of digital space that reports back with suggestions and proposals The renegade escaping the internet, looking for the next network to exploit. This character will reappear in parts of the thesis to show its views and shake things up. This is the burst that precedes the fall._

##Control and Ego, Suffering  
_What are “filter bubbles” good for? How do social media pull us in? Why do we keep coming back to it? What is the role of the ego in these networks? Can people control their impulses? Are we being dominated by computers and machines? What efforts are people making to take control of their own impulses? How do people try to escape the internet?_

##Strategies from History  
_With a focus on the history of addiction / conditioning research and computing / tech / systems research: Can we learn from history? Which ways does history repeat itself? How can we learn from that to improve?_

##Fleeting Time  
_Who’s time are you spending? Are you planning flexibly towards yourself? Philosophising about ways to live, play, and work._

##Optimization X Disaster  
_Personal optimization is an ideal in health and in work. Do the ends justify the means? Are we adapting willingly to systems that will drive us into extinction? Formula life, the food / nutrition debate, fueled by sponsored brands._
 
##Malleability, Makeability and Myth  
_Should mankind always improve itself? After looking at the dynamic of self control is it really useful? Why do people seem to be interested in personal achievement so much? Critiquing the thesis that we are living in a simulation. Using that example to drag people out of their personal sphere and wake them up to a world where people live, work, love together (utopian view) or to show them a world where people do not live, work, love together (dystopian view)_

##Boring Internet  
_Why are we annoyed by the internet? In who’s interest are you using the WWW? How does web design reflect the current ideals of success and career? How would the internet have changed our society and how did it play out?_

##Conclusion  
_If design lives on, this is how it should work to deal with corporate powers, third, fourth, fifth parties’ interests and, last but not least, the self._
