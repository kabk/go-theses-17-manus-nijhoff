##PITFALLS, BACK OF HEAD

- NB that the character pointers are not mentioned explicitly more than once. No need for typecasting. Suggestion is key.
- I want to avoid coming to a premature conclusion or opinion by writing “personally”.  
- Maybe there is something better to say about the internet than a lesson per se. I wanna avoid my writing to become patronizing and/or demonizing, mainly because that seems to be countereffective...
- I am always open for responses at [manusnijhoff@gmail.com](mailto:manusnijhoff@gmail.com) for objections, comments and insights.
