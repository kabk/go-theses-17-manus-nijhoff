##Introduction 

>"Cover the window, please. These mountains give me no ideas."

I am no authority on design and on the internet. But I have experience with both. And I have some views I want to put on paper. So bear with me for this ride. It won't be pretty, I hope.

_I hope_, because pretty is not the kind of quality that is at the beginning of creation. Pretty is how it can end up. And to end up there means to struggle. _No pain no gain_.

As a designer, I work mainly in the digital world. I use interfaces to create order and - increasingly - experiences. Design is a service. I am no exception to many other occupations in that aspect. But there is a difference, namely that get a glipse of what is behind the interface. Design deals with systems and structures and how they shape things.

I'm always interested in details. I look in this thesis for answers to questions that are in the

The connection between front-end and back-end, between less and more and more and more, what's _pain for gain_?

The new focus is on productivity, making time for more work. We don't work efficiently but are constantly talking about efficiency.

I don't want to untangle the wires. I want to show you the chaos that's happening all around us and that we're not that perfect. It's a miracle your wi-fi still works.

Ambient design, gonzo, we think we're solving problems but we're not? Apathy from technology?

We live with internet. In 2007, already 97% of all telecommunications went through the internet. 

I feel the need to map out some tendencies that are supported by the internet. I think there are some things usually overlooked in passage. 

The designer has always been, as well as the designer, the user of his / her designs. In the technological era, that remains true. Creation relies on your bandwidth, your imagination is the limit, and _solutions have to be found within_. In the digital, creation instantly means participation. 

You contribute to a stream. You can build dams and dig canals to guide the flow, you can ride your boat on top of the stream or fish from it, sitting on the river bank. You can go with or against the stream, you can drown. But most importantly: _You_ have the power to do _all of that_. That's the feeling. What's it really?

I will use as much as I know about this freak-world of the internet to make some suggestions and propositions of how designers as well as normal people can relate to the internet. 

Looking into the back-end, the network servers and programs that run in the background, offers a strange view of the world. The cloud is servers spinning on a rack, interconnected with cables. 

Wireless is only a half-truth. There are cables attached.

##Reverence for Technology

Draag ik als ontwerper bij aan de verheerlijking van technologie?

Which systems in the world are essentially attuned to human needs?

>In the age of Big Iron, big organizations paid big bucks to IBM and the rest for big databases and put all their most precious data assets in these systems: their institutional memory and customer relationships.

> If it does not fit in the database, it does not exist.

Interoperation between personal computers and big databases wasn't easy. Now it is much more convenient. That brings huge advantages for the individual, since you can create much more, but it allows at the same time noise and pollution.

I’m interested to find out what the apathic side of society is, and how design fuels that movement. In politics, is apathy not voting. In work, is apathy not working? What is apathy in design
? Are we making apathic designs? 

Connected to apathy is the rule of systems, and more importantly the subconscious influence of systems on daily life. Freedom of expression is filtered through the internet’s giant’s services. Though this is a reality we are facing, I wonder if there really is no freedom to revolt and shake things up.

In this train of thought I remember writing about how sitting still, and being lost in the internet for a long time, has motivated me. In a way, it seems that you have to go too far, before you really understand the impact of the media that surround you. I imagine a kind of Gonzo-approach to social media or internet culture in general. And I imagine that I am not the only one.

Gonzo was the journalistic approach of writer Hunter S. Thompson to his stories. He immersed himself into the hedonistic worlds he was reporting on. This resulted in a writing style which left some room for the reader to interpret what was real and what was not. But, as is pointed out, it is not that difference which defines ‘gonzo’. Rather it is the impossibility to see the author as disconnected from the topic they are writing on. It is a journalistic style that does not claim objectivity.

##Complex, Big Internet

There is no way we can talk about 'The Internet' anymore. This is like talking about The World. It just does not make sense anymore.

The lobster screams its pain underwater. Though I and you are not sure if the lobster is in actual pain, we are sure that it is dying in miserable circumstances and we also know that it is involuntarily put in this boiling water and we also know that it is for the eater’s pleasure.

Are we all just singing lobsters in the boiling pot of GAFAM?

>Stacks.  In 2012 it made less and less sense to talk about "the Internet," "the PC business," "telephones," "Silicon Valley," or "the media," and much more sense to just study Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft.  These big five American vertically organized silos are re-making the world in their image.  

>If you're Nokia or HP or a Japanese electronics manufacturer, they stole all your oxygen.  There will be a whole lot happening among these five vast entities in 2013.  They never 		compete head-to-head, but they're all fascinated by "disruption."

This statement, written in 2012, is very captivating. We deal more often with these companies then we do with our own governments. If you are a user of the internet, at least (GAFAM). The GAFAM syndicate’s grip on daily life is the new political power. It is more established than the chaotic politics all over Europe, or the chaotic politics over in the United States.

Benjamin’s Stack exists of the following layers:

User  
Interface  
Adress  
City  
Cloud  
Earth  

Why complex problems are interesting

With fooling you can find out way more than from stating facts. The first thing you do when someone fools you, is to find their ways. It's a domesticated failure, of which recovering is easy.

**Of course there is no focus.** We need a new definition of the state we call focus. And we should work and teach with ever-changing surroundings. It makes sense to me to consider the ever-changing as the only steady thing there is. 

WIRELESS IS AN ILLUSION

NO CABLES ATTACHED

Against oversimplification

Design has to show complexity, and make it less complex.

At Netflix server centers they have this approach called the Chaos Monkey. This basically shuts down random parts of their server infrastructure with the only reason to see if the system stays up. This could probably also be called the bacterial approach, since the system _needs_ these little destructions to survive, just like organisms are dependent on smaller creatures or bacteria to survive. 

In 2012 Netflix released an open source version of the software, giving others access to the Simian Army. It would be very good to see a Chaos Monkey in real life. What would the Chaos Monkey approach to design mean? 

Graphic design is based on planning, moral and aesthetic choices. A design holds up by test of time, or by acceptance among people. These time-based, ethical and popular successes can be wrecked by the Chaos Monkey Of Design.

Back end is very complex, front end extremely simple. Most people are shielded from complexity. We create systems that nobody understands.
Users / consumers don't care as long as it works.
It's one thing to say: There is an expert somewhere that knows what's going on and we outsource our understanding to them. But more and more there is no such expert. Each of us has some way of thinking about these systems. 
Not being able to understand it is the cool thing. Hack, clooge are celebrated terms. When is a hack detrimental to society?
Large system. Only way to change it is through hacks. But: u dont understand whats going on. Left with intangible mess. We should be deliberate in how we grow these systems. Especially as from scratch. Not a cloogy approach. Grown not engineered. 
Evolutionary nature
Evolved feature, repurposing a phenotypic thing, obsolete code. When systems get big enough they almost seem biological.
As the sites are being built. Change Review Board.12 people. 1 network 1 storage 1 application development 1 servers - > review every change. Say it out loud and see if the other 'worlds' agree. Reverse when there are problems. Same people come together to find out what is causing the problem.

Up until now programming was functional procedural. If loops Basically predict enough states so the computer can do the calculation. If this, do that.
With deep learning comes a probabalistic reasoning system. If I see this input, I think I should do X. 
Explicit vs probabalistic.
Sociological. -> computers were exact precise things. When do people think computers are biological. people have a low tolerance for error for anything that comes out of a computer. 
Don't panic does not work for people. 
Netflixxxxxx chaos monkey. Tool periodically takes subsystems out of commision and sees how it responds. Idea is to lower gap between how they expect the system to work and how the system actually works. In biology this is how you learn about a living thing. Actively try mutating is biological technique. Using biological techniques!
Biological thinking approach: These things are very complex. They've evolved over time and have this organic messiness. We need to focus much more on the details of the subsystems. The details of a component in the hope of creating a broader picture. The details really matter. 
It's a good framework we should import into the build world.
Who's data center do you want to look like? Wall Street Banks ≠ Facebook.
Any process could die at any time but the system needs to survive any given failure. Single disk drive can die. Terms used: resilient, robust.
Delivering technology to people; 
Google pioneered 'continuous failure'. It will fail.
Backend designed in a biological way.
Humans conditioned to accept inherent complexity. (doctor example). Wonder if we get to the same point with computers.
Almost like a humility in the face of technology. We freak out or say this is so complicated (awe). Both cut off questioning. We need to recognize humble approach that it is okay not to always understand. Constantly trying to understand and being excited by trying to understand. Realizing things are messy but also something we created. 
Narrative around creation and who created what. People build on each others idea it is messy and complex. Systems are more complex.


##Real Time and Fleeting Time 

In ‘Atemporality for the Creative Artist’, Bruce Sterling describes a problem with network culture. He says we are in a state of chaos, a state of constant emergency when it comes to intellectual labor. He uses the term atemporality to describe an issue we have with the immense new public domain, things like collective knowledge and the loss of a canon and a record. He then explains that this problem is reality, we are living it, and proposes ways to deal with the situation.

Possibilities of Real Time for design.

Advantages of a gonzo approach.

I LIKE TO BE IMMERSED

go to mars, upload your conscience into a future robot, deny that we are living in a real world

Silicon Valley Scientist-Entrepreneurs believe there is a big chance we are already living in a simulation á la Matrix.

_Why do people work?_

Push the button, pull the lever, check the reading. After 200 years of industrial innovation, he says, this is what he does. He goes on about motivation. The only motivation is the pay-check, that allows him to do spend money on things he loves. The entire time the camera is panned in on his face and upper body against a monotone background. All the while talking, he has been pushing the button, pulling the lever and checking the reading, but by the time he has finished his rant, the camera pans out and we realize that the button and lever belong to a slot machine. 

I think this is very interesting because the man has the idea that his work is a drag, but he unknowingly lives the same routine in his spare time, which is exactly the same drag his work is supposed to be.

I think this is a phenomenon that still happens. You might complain that you spend too much time in front of a computer. When you are off work however, laptops awake from slumber, Facebook is on, Netflix is on, screens are on, emails are written. The screens never mattered in the first place.

People seem to never really admit to be satisfied by their work but rather define themselves by what they do on their ‘free’ time. In the opposite, there are the people that define themselves with the jobs they do because they really identify with their jobs and love to do them. 

Psychogeography is a great concept since it’s all about the moment and the experience.
They walk around in city. They like to get lost. 
They gather together and talk about their experience.
They take it seriously, and enjoy dériving.

Can psychogeography be applied on the internet?

>Collecting is not the preferred action in the case of digital melancholia. It will only lead to frustration because the subject matter is a feeling.

>Recording is another action that could be undertaken. Maybe the confrontation with hard facts about our own behavior can give us something to push away from. But this isn't the full solution. Everyone that has a habit knows how hard it can be to get rid of one.

>Acting out would be something that I could see do something. It should be the climax that comes from this. To release the complex emotions aroused by the (touch) screen and test them with other people.

Consider the dérive, which was an act of getting lost for the purpose of getting lost. Now, in the time of digital existential crisis, we were disillusoned by the wanderings we have online. Bored after the big promise. We expect a lot, but end up chasing the dragon. Where the derive IRL is a pastime that makes for unexpected discoveries, surely. Surely human beings are random?! The on-screen version of this – randomly browsing the web – – with a little disregard of what the derive is supposed to be, a psychogeographical exploration – does not offer the same randomness. 

>Feeling like I should get to a point here, I propose using the _fata morgana_ as fuel on the fire. There is an illusion of order, which we should expose. Like the Situationists, lift up and follow your passions, and use the mega surroundings that are given by modern modern society,

Manuel Bürger -> lost in connotation, driven by the fascination of the incomprehensible

>ˮThe Translit reader knows there is a spirituality lacking in the modern world that can only be squeezed out of other, more authentic eras.”  

> – Douglas Coupland

Translit is a literary genre that combines different timeframes and locations. Seemingly disconnected places and times work together in order to form a general narrative. The writer relies on the reader to make his or her way through time jumps and location-shifts as the book moves on. The name translit was invented in an essay by Douglas Coupland, who praises this approach. He argues even that it’s an essential skill. 

>“Genre shifting is as fundamental to working with words as is punctuation and knowing the difference between serifs and sans-serifs.” 

I like the idea of shifting timeframes / genres. It seems essential to a life lived with, raised by and chock-full of media. We get snippets and flashes of other realities and fantasies than our own. We can be exposed to simulations of other realities with greater and greater detail. The idea of shifting identity seems legitimate as well. Interacting through different channels real life and simulated life allows us to do that. 

ENNUI

How do we even call society today? Does modern still fit? Are we at the apex of modernity? Should we call it fogdernity? Should we call it optimization and autocorrectity? The Decades of Political Autocorrectness? No. It does not seem to me that the media live the great power they’ve been asserted. No, don’t mistake me, I mean that even with all of our sophisticated-not-so-sophisticated-because-we-are-still-bleeping-the-fucks-on-television technology there is so much of political stupidity, racism, and hate.

>Take yourself out when the screen has been fully saturated. Go past it and over it. Go outside or do something with the new-found feelings you discovered by going into the pit of internet. I guess this would be different for everyone how you would deal with it. There is not one right answer. But this is the method I propose:

*Catch yourself in the spiral  
*Leave, if you want.  
*Go with it, but be aware of your own feelings.  
*When a border has been reached (You are panicking, unrest, )  

>Now, take action.

Coming back on this after a couple of weeks: _In his book Nostalgia for the Absolute_, George Steiner touches on this idea. There is a certain bow of stress, (spanningsboog) that gets stressed under inactivity. Inactivity is the catalyst for action. When a problem is not addressed for a while, it grows worse. It starts to be noticed again when it gets really bad, and this is when people step in and try to fix it. I notice this, personally, in procrastination. A task that is left alone for long enough, grows more painful or powerful, the closer you get to an actual deadline or critical point in development. The spiral of browsing and procrastinating fuels the need to address it. In the body, this phenomen manifests itself in muscles. An unused muscle will gather toxic fluids in its fibers when it isn't used for a longer period of time. The pain caused by the toxins stimulates the body to get going, to get up and running again.

Frustration / anger turned into creativity.

##Ahead of Time

>“We are men of action, lies do not become us”

Advantages of a managed time-approach. 

Forecasting.
Precommerce -> the possibility of customization

The ones that are ahead of time decide for those who are lagging behind. Those will have to deal with the consequences of that. 

In his piece “Double In Fugue” Robert Rapoport describes the Remembrancer of London, a man that used to play a truly important economical part in the daily life of London’s _City_, the financial district. The remembrancer today serves a purely ceremonial function. 

The Office was set up to act as the corporate memory and this is reflected today in his role of advising the City Corporation on constitutional issues

Placeless, timeless, less identity, we can become ambient if we want.


##Distraction Addiction / Destination Procrastination / Filter Troubles

To me, there seems to be no life without distraction. So what could be ways of embracing this and moving through the distractions, rather than submerging into the streams. How to ride the waves and which waves to look out for? 

In my experience a problem with working on something big, like a thesis, is that it does not require shifting attention, but rather a very steady, sometimes slow, but most of all consistent pace. I am conditioned to continually adapt and change and customize and modify. But I don’t always need that when putting in some real, constructive effort. So, I live. While I divert into less constructive business that satisfies my need for constant distraction.   

Nicholas Carr identified this as a problem in his book The Shallows.

browsing history decides browsing future.

I would like to learn something out of this maniacal and chaotic crazy thing that I’ve been feeding off of, I’ve been contributing to, I’ve felt at home in for a long time. 

In Adam Curtis' documentary _HyperNormalisation_, I saw this singer, Patti Smith, who was deeply intrigued by the way people on the street acted in New York City. She notices people that walk around and look at the previews of movies in Macey’s shop windows. She has the outsider view, the overview. An overview much more interesting than the one from the top of the sky scraper. A view much more complex as well. This outsiders view is very interesting, because she was still in the same sphere of influence as the others, but just looked on instead of participating in the hype.

>“Men seldom moved their bodies; all unrest was concentrated in the soul.”

In the television series Mr. Robot, the sense of human disconnection is all apparent. The people in the series are disillusioned, disappointed and lonely. Creator Sam Esmail explained that the show explores how loneliness looks in today’s world.

In Louis Theroux' documentary of the high-security prison San Quentin,[^san-quentin] I could see some parallels of how the internet works on social structures. I don't mean to say that social networks are a prison, bear with me.

Participatory media allows you to reach people that you didn't know existed in the first place. It allows you to communicate, talk, make love, basically any human exchange is made possible through the medium. But: always _within the limits of that medium_. The following comparison to the prison system only differs on the point that social media allows an escape, which in the prison model only works after ‘doing your time’. 

He walks into the yard with the prisoners. 
He talks to the inmate who tortured many people. 
What does it take to do that? (walking into the ‘yard’)
Is it courage? Or more curiosity?
He has to be courageous in order to feed his curiosity.
He uses the power of the camera. The authority of the medium. 
To find out what not many have found. The human aspects of being imprisoned, the things it does to them.
The ways social structures are invented.
The ways people deal with their convictions.
And how people keep or maintain, even invent an identity.

Being outside of daily societal reality, the prisoners make their own version of reality. In the second season of Sam Esmail's series _Mr. Robot_, Elliot uses his imagination to escape from the mental stress in prison. He makes up an entire story line in which visits of his sister in prison are replaced with visits at his mother's place. His alternative reality is staged in the real world, where prison routines become mundane routines. Breakfast is eaten at the same table in the same diner with the same friend. 

Elliot escapes: Prison reality -> daily reality.

People escape: Daily reality -> online reality.

I would argue that there is some overlap with social media. Subcultures form and create teir own identities. It supports a social structure where like-minded people are put together in a concentrated sphere of influence. In the prison model, this may be criminals from different backgrounds and convictions. Here, the only thing the inmates have to identify is their body. Depending on skin color an inmate gets automatically put in a gang. It is impossible to hide your identity, that gets superimposed. While online, it is much easier to shape yourself.

SPEED

And we love the hyperspeed of the medium.

How do you even make a clear speech these days? How do you talk or write, without a background music, or a background image? Without subtitles? Without shouting? Without elevator-pitching? ( Without making a god-damned point ). There seems always to be someone out to get your attention, your time, your cash. This sentiment is everywhere online.

Notifications are the most explicit example of this. 

In programming, it is often considered bad practice to prepare variables (pieces of text or numbers) for later use when you can also create them ‘on the go.’ It can be faster, or easier to understand for others to read. Now I always prepare for things, and often don’t finish them. I like to create stuff, I do not like to deal with the results. 
This is the lazy, uncaring part of me that is also writing this thesis. This part likes to procrastinate and always finds the next interesting thing. And it does make a lot of nice discoveries. And it is in essence the explorer part of me that got me interested in research. And when you ask this part a question in a tone that he doesn’t like, for example; ‘hey, do you have the research question somewhere?’ *worried tone*, this part says that it might have it, yes, just let me read one more page. This one finds all the good resources but never registers them. But then again, if it did, I would probably be a hoarder.

I think many practices that are very normal to do online, don't always fit the offline world.

_One more page_ was always a joke in my family. I would be reading a book in bed before going to sleep and my parents would come to tell me to go to sleep and I would say ‘one more page’ and keep reading. 

I wrote this when I started to get into a less productive streak of writing:

>Do you ever feel like you ever really finish something? I think I’m predestined to unfinished work. Can you give me some tips, or maybe some sources, reference material? I could write a book about unfinished business! It will never be finished.  
> 
>Hmm…

This line of thought sums up how the internet works its effect on me. There is an intention, but this intention gets consumed by the tools I use to make the intentions into realities.

Multidisciplinary Artist, multidisciplinary designer. It used to be terms like these that made people very enthousiastic. “Ik vind dat ik alles zou moeten kunnen en doe daarom dat, alles.” 

DARK PATTERN DESIGN

Some simply don't notice. Others have made the purchase but are too lazy or busy to do anything about it. (what's the border between lazy and busy? apathic and pro-active?)

People usually scan-read, not “read” read, and this is what UI designers are taking advantage of.

Dark patterns are setting a bad example. They work with an _easy-in, difficult out_ method.

Designers could identify probably with a split that's been a reality in tech for years. The concept of the White Hat Hacker and the Black Hat hacker. White hats are the ‘good ones,’ hacking a program for Robin Hood reasons or because they want to expose the weaknesses in the system. 

Of course it isn't as easy to split good and bad this binary, but it does give a value judgement. White hat activity can be compared to healthy habits as black is the unhealthy habit. 

Let me stress that I know many people that I admire and respect highly, that have unhealthy habits as well.

##Optimization / Control and Suffering / Makeability and Myth

>“Decisiveness is important. A true Samurai makes his decision within seven breaths …”

Ik ben voorstander van snelle beslissingen, en dat beslissingen gemaakt worden vanuit jezelf. Dat is een mooi onderdeel van mentale vrijheid. Ik sta echter ook voor honderd procent achter dwellen.

Food and drink is disconnected from human taste (overly tasteful / purely functional, Soylent on steroids)

Parable: On Time

It's funny with our perception of time. While we seem so much more precise now in predicting and planning time, this can also be a farce. We plan, but immediately fail to fulfill the planned time, so we plan again, or communicate our exact delay to the people we would meet.
I would meet Richard at 14:00 at the museum. He messaged me at 13:06 if our meeting could be pushed back to 14:30, 15:00 even. I agreed with that at 13:31, stating I would be there from 14:00 until 16:30 anyways. I arrived at the museum at 14:58 where I had a small talk with a former colleague. At 15:03, I walked into the restaurant to miss Richard there. He texted me exactly then that he would be here at 15:10. Time of writing now is 15:11. Waiting for Richard's call.

Troy Hunt, an entrepreneur, most famous for the site _Have I Been Pwned?_ on which you can find out if your data has been disclosed wrongfully, wrote a blog entry about the ways he optimized his life.

>“I’m (...) very aware of when I’m becoming unproductive. For example, when a tweet or a notification distracts me. There’s something that triggers and says “Hey, you’re going off track, this is keeping you from what’s important” and I try to adjust accordingly. Doesn’t always happen of course, but at least I’m conscious of inefficiency.”

This man is very aware of his own shortcomings and weaknesses and, while he admits to also letting go sometimes, is in control of the situation. He is the role model of the modern worker. Independent, self-sufficient, optimizing and adjusting his every move along the way. He is the embodiment of performance. The slick, well-running computer, et cetera.

I realized while I was reading the post, that Hunt has an inner drive which is left undiscussed. He is a man that enjoys life. He gets kicks out of his own work. The way he works is enviable, the energy uplifting.

Surely, he is not the only one that works in this way. People that love their job and their life have probably been around forever. His example just reflects the ideals of today’s society the most.

WORKFLOW

A friend of mine _(s/o to Rik)_ told me that his way of working is in short but extremely heavy, concentrated spurts of work. He would be sedentary in a kind of slumber. Resting, but feeding. Power-charging the battery for a long boost of energy after which there is another cooling down period. 

I wonder if it makes sense for people to work like this. For lithium-ion batteries it is not recommended to use them until completely empty. When used this way, they don’t get as old.

A way I see more often in the way Hanna and Rasmus work is the steady one. They have multiple threads running at the same time and by checking into each project every day they spread their energy and work steadily throughout a longer period of time. Along the longer time scale, they seem to have spent a lot of time optimizing this workflow. Making the work lighter and easier to reuse is not a boring bureaucratic business, although it can become that if it becomes a goal in itself. It’s a matter of maintenance. In code, it is a very natural and obvious process. It needs to happen in order to work properly. Minification, concatenation, clarification, they all work for you when writing (code). The pleasure of optimizing is like the pleasure of cleaning. Essentially they achieve the same thing. 

Charlie Stigler

>I am not a strict abstainer from much! It's just not what works for me personally - I have very good control over habits like that and don't tend towards addiction, so it doesn't help me to be strict. I certainly go easy on things that aren't good for me - like alcohol, drugs, sugar, phone time, and poisonous people - but I'm fine with most things in moderation.  

>_The idea of perfecting yourself is ubiquitous in our western societies. How do you feel about this ideal of ‘self-optimization’ and what role does self-control play in this?_    
I'm glad that people are being intentional and thinking about what they want, so in that sense self-optimization is a good thing. But where it gets dangerous is when it leads people to multitasking and losing focus. People start to feel like time spent doing only one thing - appreciating your dinner, walking through a crowded street, listening to music - is wasted. And they start to pull out their phones during all of these things to find more stimuli. But of course, we can only do one thing at a time well! We need to learn to focus more on the things we're doing, not rush to do more and more at the same time.

>“We Are as Gods and we might as well get used to it.”  
>Stewart Brand

I had this quote in my quote folder for a while. I think this is part of Steward Brand’s introduction to the Whole Earth Catalog. I remade the title of the pic now into I guess I do not really agree. The piece of text now leaves me with questions such as: Who is now seeking and promoting tools for the power of the individual? What are the motivations for a personal power as such? With whom are you sharing your adventure? Do you have the power to shape your own environment?


##Crowd and the Melinnial

I would actually love to write a book with a crowd of people. Real Time.

The act of correction is not that I make something, and you strike it through and replace it with your words. That is not what I would call a fair game. Instead, wouldn’t it be much better if we had a direct resistance from persons, or maybe robots, when we write what we write. 
Which technologies enable a fair platform for discussion and correction, without becoming the all seeing eye that manipulates? What I’m trying to say is how can a human being maintain control over their own intellect, and have meaningful, educational, fun and young interactions through discussion? 

The world behaves in interesting ways.

Later op de avond keken we naar – omgekeerde – kaarten van de wereld. Het is bizar om je te realiseren hoezeer je eigen kijk naar internationale politiek beïnvloed is door het beeld van de wereldkaart. De schaal waarop landen zich tot elkaar verhouden is een erg ongrijpbaar begrip, maar als je een kaart ziet denk je het antwoord te hebben, terwijl het een bepaalde projectie van een essentieel on-plat-voorwerp (de aardbol) op een essentieel plat voorwerp is (de landkaart).

##Conclusion  

Here I am, stabbing at air.
